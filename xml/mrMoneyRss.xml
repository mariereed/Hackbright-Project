<p><em><strong>MMM Note:</strong> The following is a lesson from our Canadian friend Mr. Frugal Toque, a long-time reader and contributor to this blog, and soon-to-be early retiree.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>“This above all: to thine own self be true.” </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8211; Commander Data, probably quoting some old English guy.</em></p>
<p></div></p>
<p>I can’t say for certain that we Mustachians need <em>perfect</em> honesty: I’d be lying to you. But if we’re to proceed with the utmost efficiency, we’re going to have to at least cut the crap out of our own lives when we look in the mirror and get down to business.</p>
<p>Do you drive a car? I do. Do you lie to yourself about how much the use of that car costs? I used to.</p>
<p>The Toque family makes an annual visit to Grandpa and Grandma Toque every summer, a family reunion of sorts to meet up with the entire Toque clan. Mrs. Toque and I would always record this journey, 600km in each direction, at a reasonable cost of about $100: billing the whole thing to ourselves as if it were simply the cost of gas.</p>
<p>We’ve made this journey for 18 years, every summer we’ve been married and the one before that, and sometimes more than once per year. To add to the issue, before we’d even met, I’d make that 1200 km round trip several times a year in a small sports car with at most one passenger, always billing it in my head as the price of gas.</p>
<p>I would lie to myself, basically. Even while train rides made themselves available, at something like $70 or so round trip, I’d take my own car because, “Hey, it’s the same price, right? Plus, I’ll have my car with me when I get there.”</p>
<p>Never mind that the Toque grandparents live within walking distance to <b>everything </b>and had extra space in their car for events farther away. No, I took my turbo-charged sports car on that long journey, never really accounting for the insurance, maintenance and depreciation it cost me.</p>
<p>Nowadays, having chosen the career Software Engineer over Professional Race Car Driver, I got rid of the sports beast and drive a tidy little Nissan Versa. It only burns through my cash at about 20 cents per km. Despite this savings, this past summer, we took the train on our annual sojourn.</p>
<p>First of all, I have to say, “Holy shit! Trains are awesome.”</p>
<p>If we book our train seats all at once, Mrs. Toque and I and get two comfy seats facing our two children. Then, like a particularly fast cloud, we get to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0wvNvrRL8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drift lazily past all of the highways </a>we’d normally find ourselves jammed up in. I calculate many tens of dollars of benefits associated with the absence of swearing at stupid drivers and worrying about getting ourselves in another highway collision requiring the procurement of a new car.</p>
<p>In my sports car days, my racing vehicle must have burned through at least 40 cents per km, some $500 per round trip, when a VIA train ride would have cost a tiny fraction of that for a single person. Nowadays, with four seats purchased for the entire Toque family, the cost of the equivalent train ride runs up to $360, exactly the cost of taking an average 30 cents/km car on the same trip.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: the cost of the train ride is <i>honest.</i> Our consumption stares at us, right there when we hand our credit card information over and click “Proceed with Order”. It doesn&#8217;t hide away in the depreciation of our car, maintenance costs and insurance. We can’t lie to ourselves that our trip only costs the price of gas.</p>
<p>Yes, nowadays we drive a cheaper car.  But taking a car because it’s cheaper is <i>still</i> lying to ourselves. Believe it or not, many of the costs of driving a car are hidden away in road maintenance and pollution, line items we find really hard to quantify. I feel confident, mind you, that if we were to find a way to quantify the damage exhaust fumes do and the subsidies that go into highways versus railroads, we would discover that the train ride costs a <em>lot </em>less.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by saying that we can get richer through the use of Conspicuous Consumption. By putting your consumption out there where you can’t hide it, where you have complete honesty, you’ll find yourself getting richer. If, when I’d driven an Eagle Talon TSi, I’d been honest with myself, I’d have saved over a thousand dollars in wear and tear on my car <i>every year</i>.</p>
<p>Moving on, I’d like to give one more example.</p>
<p>A few years back, Mrs. Toque had lamented that many of the children’s Lego constructions had grown dusty. Since the mini Toques wanted to keep many of their toys in the fully assembled state for playing purposes, they would store their toys on dresser tops and inside bookshelves. Layers of dust had accumulated and become unsightly. Now, you might begin to wonder, how many Lego sets are we talking? Figure for a pair of boys, 9 and 11 years of age, receiving a Lego set for each birthday and Christmas since they turned 4 or so. Add in there Mr. Toque’s own building block stash from his own childhood, and we have a lot of the magical clicky-blocks hanging around.</p>
<p>Mrs. Toque wisely proposed the purchasing of a set of simple glass cabinets, which the children could easily operate to retrieve their toys, but would encourage them to “put things away”, and also keep dust from accumulating on them in an unsightly fashion.  As a side note, many of these cabinets can be found cheap, but slightly used, over the Internet.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Conspicuous Consumption? Behold the image.</p>

<p>We’ve discovered a delightful side effect of these cabinets, and thus I&#8217;m writing to you about it.  Whenever the children show interest in acquiring new toys with their allowance, we take a moment and pause in front of the glass cabinets to look at all of the toys currently available.  Are you certain this new toy is significantly different from the toys you have here?  Isn&#8217;t such-and-such just a re-paint of so-and-so?  Is the new toy going to increase your happiness enough that it&#8217;s worth the allowance money you&#8217;ll use up?</p>
<p>Like many other money-related exercises, the goal is to build habits in our children that will serve them for life by preventing them from becoming Clown Consumers looking for happiness at the far end of their credit cards&#8217; limits.</p>

<p>It’s not fool proof, mind you. Allowance still flows into toys, but even the younger of the two brothers, at nine years, shows a lot more conscientiousness  about it. He has since built a fleet of his own creations, rather than relying on the official designs, and he spends a bit of time disassembling the formal constructions in order to harvest pieces from them.</p>
<p>There you are: a Hot Tip from the man in the Cold North.  Make your consumption as conspicuous as possible and learn the very finest lessons from it.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago, I got a surprise in the mail. It was a very expensive registration renewal bill* from Boulder County, reminding me that my brand-new 2016 Nissan Leaf was already a whole year old.</p>
<p>The car has now been through the full cycle of Colorado&#8217;s interesting driving conditions including blazing sunshine, blowing blizzards, rough roads and high mountain passes. More importantly, it has carried large loads of heavy people and one hatchback-busting load of cargo after another as I used it for endless construction projects as well as shuttling around visitors and even a few paying passengers as part of a related Uber-driving experiment.</p>
<p>Since I <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/04/so-i-bought-an-electric-car/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bought the car</a> primarily so I could tell <em>you</em> about the experience**, this one year anniversary presents the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>Electric cars have been getting better and cheaper very quickly. Even a year ago, they were competitive with gas cars (especially after applying the various tax credits available here in the US). And as of late 2017, Nissan has just announced a thoroughly <a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/electric-cars/2018-leaf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated 2018 Leaf </a>with longer range, new styling, and even semi-autonomous highway cruising, at the same list price.</p>
<p>Halfway through my time writing this article, General Motors announced that it is <a href="https://t.co/EU62PW5yZD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">totally giving up the gasoline engine</a> and switching to a 100% electric fleet in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Changes like these will get even more people asking questions, and it will surely trigger even bigger discounts on the 2017 and earlier models of electric cars. In certain areas, you can get a brand-new 2017 Leaf for well under $14,000 and a 2013 from Craigslist for under $8k.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get into the report. All year, people have been asking what the electric car experience has been like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the car reliable? Any unexpected hiccups?</li>
<li>How has the range and performance been in various use scenarios?</li>
<li>How good does an electric car like the Nissan Leaf handle in the snow?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Life with a Leaf</strong></p>
<p>If you just want the overall summary, the car has been Excellent.<strong> </strong>Although I did my best to maximize the mileage we accrued on this car over the year, the total still only added up to <strong>3500 miles</strong> (5600 km). But what a blissful 3500 miles those were. The car served us generously, requiring nothing in return beyond refilling the windshield washer fluid once.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>It is hard to believe the night and day difference between gasoline cars and electric ones, in terms of sheer driving pleasure and convenience. The difference is so stark, that I now feel utter disbelief that <em>any</em> car company is still making gas-powered cars, and that anyone is buying them for anything other than long roadtrips (and for those, why not just rent a car?) Even the most luxurious gas cars, of which I&#8217;ve driven a few, are complete dinosaurs in comparison to an entry-level electric car like Nissan Leaf.</p>
<p>Now, this is definitely my Wussypants Consumer side speaking, displaying signs of <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/12/26/cure-yourself-of-tiny-details-exaggeration-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiny Details Exaggeration Syndrome</a>. Even the cheapest 30-year-old gas car offers incredible speed, comfortable seats and an environmentally controlled seating area. So what&#8217;s the point of scaling that ladder of luxury even further?</p>
<p>The short answer is &#8220;Car Culture&#8221; : the only real purpose of a car is convenience and comfort &#8211; people buy them because they can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to do the work of pedaling a bike, and to carry their little kids in safety, and to stay out of the weather. So if you&#8217;re going to buy a car, you are presumably looking for those things, which electric cars deliver in exceptional quantity.</p>
<p>The Leaf is Swift. Tight. Precise. It drives like a very sporty car and jumps ahead when you touch the accelerator as if it weighs nothing at all. But it&#8217;s also hushed, refined, and serene inside. As you accelerate and leave all the gas cars far behind in your wake of clean swirling air, you hear just a distant whirring turbine sound as the electric motor picks up speed. On the open road even at the vehicle&#8217;s RPM-limited top speed of 93 MPH, the ride is quiet and controlled.</p>
<p>The Leaf is also big. It&#8217;s relatively long and tall, which makes it roomy inside. I think of it as more of a crossover SUV, with its cabin big enough for five six-foot-tall men, and a hatchback big enough to hold two more of us. If you fold down all the seats, that same area is long enough to close the door on two bikes or numerous ten-foot plumbing pipes. The 17&#8243; wheels are bigger than those on my enormous Honda van, which gives it great rough terrain and snow abilities (a larger wheel diameter improves both traction and obstacle traversal.)</p>

Their Leaf easily navigates the rough dirt trail to their cottage in Quebec, carrying five people and their gear.</p></div>
<p>And it&#8217;s cheap to operate. Three dollars of electricity fills up my battery, which is good for<strong> about 110 miles of mixed driving</strong>, or closer to 90 when blazing along at 75MPH on the highway. Charging time (and finding charging stations) is rarely a concern, since  the car is always waiting at 100% if you just plug it in when you go to bed.</p>
<p>As part of my research on charging efficiency, I bought a (used) <a href="http://amzn.to/2y13lWp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chargepoint 240 volt charger</a> and installed it on my house. This made home charging really fast, but the unit doesn&#8217;t get much use: as a form of treasure hunt I still find myself using the many free public stations here in Longmont, to the extent that over 50% of my fuel for the year was free.</p>

Ignore the charge times &#8211; in many cases the car reached 100% and just sat there until I picked it up.

<p>Since the first member of my local friends bought a Leaf, the trend has spread through the community and there are now at least a dozen of the things in the area immediately around me. A friend calls the neighborhood &#8216;Leafmont, Colorado&#8217;. The inlaws back in Canada also bought one. People are using these cars for long daily commutes to Boulder and beyond, shuttling kids, shopping, and all the other stuff people shouldn&#8217;t really be doing with cars, but are going to regardless of what I say. They love their electric cars. The reviews are almost universally raving.</p>
<p>And all of this is aside from the biggest benefit, which is the hidden one that you&#8217;re not burning fossil fuels. The US power grid is down to 30% coal and getting cleaner every day, and you can personally improve that number simply by buying renewable power from your local provider as <a href="https://www.longmontcolorado.gov/departments/departments-e-m/longmont-power-communications/electric-service/renewable-energy/wind-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I do here in Longmont</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you do need to use a car on a regular basis for around-town use, there&#8217;s really no reason not to use an electric one.</p>
<p><strong>What about Winter Driving?</strong></p>

<p>The Leaf and other electric cars have big advantages over gas burners in this area as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>The electronic traction and stability control systems work much better with an electric motor, because it can be controlled more precisely. In practice this means that while a normal car would dig itself into a rut, the Leaf applies just enough power to get through the snowbank. Or it stops the wheel, giving you a chance to reverse and give it another go.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no cold-cranking worries or waiting for a cold engine to warm up. You press the button, the car is on, and cabin heat is instantaneous.</li>
<li>The heated seats and steering wheel make the experience even more luxurious (and reduce the need for cabin heat).</li>
<li>Remote heating with an in-dash timer or from an app on your phone means your car can be heated and defrosted (or cooled in summer) before you even reach it in your driveway. Without even consuming battery power, if you have the car plugged in.</li>
<li>Big wheel diameter, low center of gravity and 50/50 weight balance make for better handling and traction.</li>
<li>Front-wheel drive prevents fishtailing, and <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/12/01/all-wheel-drive-does-not-make-you-safer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is every bit as safe as all-wheel drive</a>. Adding snow tires in winter turns the Leaf into a monster snow crusher.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad Stuff</strong></p>
<p>No story (except perhaps one about bike commuting) could possibly be <em>this </em>universally positive, could it? Does Nissan have Mustache secretly on their payroll? Where&#8217;s the real meat of this story?</p>
<p>The only bad side of my experience has been finding that<strong> Nissan is a Big, Dumb, Old company</strong> to work with. To be fair, this is probably true for all car companies except Tesla, but when it comes to new technologies like electric cars, it helps to have someone who is on the ball.</p>
<p>I get the impression that somewhere, deep in the heart of Japan, there are some clever engineers who designed and built this car. Then their work was wrapped up in a thousand layers of bureaucracy and they were never allowed to talk to customers or improve their product again, until the next &#8220;product cycle&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, although I spent $14,000 of my own money and a year of my time to promote their car for free, even helping MarketWatch adapt and <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-buy-a-35000-brand-new-electric-car-for-under-14000-2016-11-02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-run the story</a> for free multiple times to their huge nationwide audience, possibly <a href="https://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boosting the car&#8217;s sales</a> quite noticeably, I couldn&#8217;t get access to a single Nissan engineer to discuss the details of the car&#8217;s battery management with me. While my local salesman is a rock star, very few other people in the company even know what a kilowatt-hour is. Perhaps they&#8217;re still riding the gasoline wave of the Nissan Armada and Titan megatrucks, which provide most of their profits.</p>
<p>Because of this, there are a few obvious brain-dead things about the Leaf:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s no battery temperature management. This means that in cold weather (15F), you get about 20% less range, even though you <em>could</em> heat the battery to room temperature with just 0.5 kWh (under 2%) of its energy. Or simply use wall power when it&#8217;s plugged in. A 20% penalty in cold climates to avoid adding a $100 heater. Why!??!</li>
<li>The phone app is horrible. I don&#8217;t mean this in the snooty way that cell phone review sites compare each year&#8217;s identical batch of high-end-phones, it really is bad. On the positive side, you can run a slightly less crappy aftermarket app called &#8220;Leaf Manager&#8221; which at least makes it usable.</li>
<li>Nissan doesn&#8217;t seem to care about its past electric car customers: The 30 kWh battery from 2016 will not fit into a 2015 Leaf, and I&#8217;m out of luck if I want to upgrade my car to any of these juicy 2018-and beyond batteries which have been improving at a rapid pace. You can upgrade to a fresh replacement of your current battery, although it&#8217;ll cost you $5500.The correct way to handle this (as Tesla does) is to make new batteries backwards-compatible whenever possible, and allow old cars to be upgraded with minimal mark-up on the battery. After all, an electric motor can run for over a million miles with zero maintenance. The rest of the car is rock-solid as well. Why not provide a path for these cars to have a healthy 30-year lifespan, getting a longer range every 10 years or so as the batteries need replacement? There&#8217;s still a chance for the company (or the aftermarket) to correct this problem, so I remain hopeful.</li>
<li>Some readers have expressed concern about the Leaf&#8217;s &#8220;driver side small overlap front crash&#8221; rating (it earns a low rating, while all other safety categories are good). I think it&#8217;s a statistically insignificant complaint, but Teslas are surely even safer. Plus, the reader correctly pointed out that if I&#8217;m going to nitpick about the phone app, I should also mention crash testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shortcomings of Nissan stir up some real anger in me. But it&#8217;s probably because I like the basic car so much. Nissan&#8217;s electric car program could capture so many more loving customers, if it were just managed by a charismatic and highly technical leader, rather than a ridiculous pyramid of corporate paper pushers.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-14392" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tesla3-300x219.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="196" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tesla3-300x219.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tesla3-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tesla3-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tesla3.jpg 703w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />If you want a passionate, perfect car and you have unlimited money, there&#8217;s only one choice: A Tesla. The Model S right now for $80,000, or a Model 3 next year for $40k.</p>
<p>If you want a <em>really good</em> electric car and don&#8217;t want to wait for a Tesla model 3, the Chevrolet Bolt is a great car with 240 miles of range, much better software, similar rockstar acceleration and &#8220;only&#8221; $30k after the $7500 federal tax credit since they haven&#8217;t run out yet.</p>
<div id="attachment_14391" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-14391" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/images.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/images.jpg 259w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/images-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/images-150x112.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chevrolet Bolt</p></div>
<p>But although it&#8217;s a better car than the Leaf, I would have a hard time justifying the extra $10,000 cost of the Bolt. The extra range makes no difference for the typical urban and suburban driving cycle. But it&#8217;s still no good for cross-country road trips because it will still only fast-charge at 50 kW, the same as a Leaf. If you can even find a fast charger out in rural Wyoming. Compare this to Teslas, which charge at 120 kW with chargers along every highway in many of the world&#8217;s rich countries.</p>
<p>But for non-millionaires, buying a $30,000 car is about as clever as shooting yourself in the wallet. It&#8217;s not even a remotely rational option, so flush it from your mind. The Nissan Leaf (and other electric mid-priced cars) are the best affordable option for driving, if you are still stuck in a life that requires a car.</p>
<p>So the Mustache family will probably be keeping the Leaf and continuing to work it hard for the coming year or more. I may add a trailer hitch and some other minor upgrades, but for the vast majority of our possible uses for a car, it&#8217;s a pretty amazing deal.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>* About $530, just for registration, just for one year. They charge you extra for the first 3 years when you get a new car around here, compared to about $50 per year for my old van and previous car, a Scion xA. The hidden costs of Luxury Racing Wheelchair ownership are really big, and often overlooked.</em></p>
<p><em>** Although certain curmudgeons in this website&#8217;s forum <a href="http://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/welcome-to-the-forum/mmm-2016-budget/msg1565670/#msg1565670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don&#8217;t believe me</a>, it&#8217;s hard to explain the shift that happens in your life when you truly don&#8217;t need a car to get around. Before the change, a car is a reassuring necessity &#8211; just as important to your life as as a bed and clothing.  After the change, you see a car for what it really is: an exorbitantly complex rolling living room. Thousands of pounds of glass and metal, with robotic arms to wipe the windows and a thousand components just for the portion to control the air temperature around you. A car is no more a reasonable form of personal transportation than a cruise ship is a vessel for weekend fishing expeditions on the lake. But, since Mr. Money Mustache represents only a very mild form of frugality, he still gets to use and review these fancy toys!</em></p>

A man was emerging from the background of other pedestrians, trying to make eye contact. We kept walking.</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Excuse Me! Gentlemen! How much are you paying for your Cable TV right now?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>I could now see that he was carrying handful of glossy flyers for one of the monthly television subscription outfits &#8211; Dish network or Comcast or whatever. The same stuff that floods my front mailbox  in far greater quantity than my ability to use it as kindling to start the woodstove on winter evenings.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Nothing&#8221;, we both said almost in unison, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have TV.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;No TV? What about Netflix? Hulu? TiVo? Google or Amazon? We can beat &#8217;em &#8211; first month is FREE!&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Nope &#8211; none of it. Sorry, we gotta go but good luck with your work today!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The solicitor was left slightly speechless. To be fair, my last line was a slight lie just for the sake of getting out of the sales pitch. We do rent movies from Google Play occasionally, but this mildly stressful street scene made me realize two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fuck, when are these slimy cable TV companies going to let up on their relentless burying of our world in their misleading &#8220;first month free&#8221; marketing campaigns? The level of promotion is always inversely proportional to the underlying usefulness of the product.</li>
<li>Man, am I really that much of a weirdo, not subscribing to any of these things that everyone else seems to use? Am I depriving my son of  a normal upbringing?</li>
</ol>
<p>But this bit of introspection goes along very well with a few other things I&#8217;ve noticed over the course of this summer. I think of them as a contrast between Mr. Money Mustache and &#8220;normal&#8221; people, and I have been pondering them for a while, deciding if I should consider becoming more normal myself.</p>
<p><strong>Should You Strive to be Normal?</strong></p>
<p>Normal people seem to be on a constant quest for action and activity. They&#8217;ll plan three lunches with friends for next week, and a weekend of drinking and motorboat riding. Every night they&#8217;ll watch TV, and on special occasions they will go out for movies, concerts or dash off to the next state to catch a football game or an eclipse. A really successful normal person is almost never at home.</p>
<p>I can definitely relate to the desire for activity. I&#8217;m incapable of spending more than an hour on the couch or sitting at the beach. During vacations, I have to find physical work projects to keep myself happily occupied. I&#8217;ve discovered that <em>even one day</em> of zero productivity is bad for me: if I stop doing things, I stop <em>wanting</em> to do things, and pretty soon I&#8217;m just lazing around on the couch or taking 11 am naps. For me, inactivity leads to a depressive boredom.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why normal people strive to keep themselves so busy. If you had a choice between &#8220;depressed naps on the couch all day&#8221; and &#8220;busy day including shopping, a lunch date, front-row Denver Broncos seats and then catching the late show at the movie theater&#8221;, you might choose the second option.</p>
<p>And even if you don&#8217;t have the time or the cash for a big expensive day like that, you might choose &#8220;A few hours of highly engaging strategy video games&#8221; or &#8220;Game of Thrones binge with my boyfriend&#8221; over the depressing alternative of Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Money Mustache&#8217;s Shocking Abnormality</strong></p>

To relax afterwards, we upgraded the front door with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2wxurqj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complex wi-fi enabled door lock</a>.</p></div>
<p>Only after carefully studying normal people have I realized my own abnormality. I haven&#8217;t had TV service since 1999, and I only catch the most highly-recommended movies from friends about once a month. I love books, but only get through about one of those per month as well &#8211; there always seems to be something more pressing than sitting down on the couch to read.</p>
<p>I never understood the joy of watching other people play sports, <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/12/20/money-mustache-vs-tourist-trap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can&#8217;t stand tourist attractions</a>, don&#8217;t sit on the beach unless there&#8217;s a <em>really</em> big sand castle that needs to be made, don&#8217;t care about what the celebrities and politicians are doing, and while I definitely get into live music, it still only happens about once every few months in practice.</p>
<p>Even wholesome outdoor recreation can be hard for me: I enjoy a good hike, but I&#8217;d rather hike around as part of volunteering to build a new trail or put up a yurt on a friend&#8217;s mountain property. I tried a day of wakeboarding with friends just recently and while it was a thrill to get up on that wave and swim around in the lake, my brain was calling me back to more productive (and less beer-soaked) pursuits the next day.</p>
<p>Instead of all this, I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. Or maybe a better description would be solving problems and making improvements.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m visiting your house, we&#8217;ll have a boring day if we play board games, but a great one if we rake the leaves and dig some trenches for an irrigation system. Even emptying out your closets so we can organize your stuff and maybe build in a few new shelves would rank higher than passive pursuits.</p>
<p>If you leave me alone for a day (unfortunately quite rare in my current family life), I&#8217;ll have a joyful time rotating between carpentry, weight training, writing, playing around with instruments in the music studio, making lists and executing tasks from them.</p>
<p><strong>Ok &#8211; Fine for You, Weirdo, but what does this have to do with Me?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s already well-known that Mr. Money Mustache has unusual habits. They wouldn&#8217;t work for everyone. But you&#8217;ll note a few things that most of them have in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>they don&#8217;t cost much to do (and some of them even generate money)</li>
<li>most of them tend to increase your physical health</li>
<li>they&#8217;re also good for your mental health and sense of life satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you already have plenty of money, you should go right on ahead and continue with the more expensive entertainment options. But if you have any use for more money, it could pay very well to at least consider some of the free or profitable things.</p>
<p>If your health and body are already exactly where you want them, it makes sense that you might continue your convenience-based habits like driving around in a car and hiring people to do the dirty work around your house. Walking that 30 minutes a day is giving you <em>exactly </em>the results you want, right? If not, it would seem logical to re-evaluate that leisure time.</p>
<p>And if you already get plenty of mental work done &#8211; your to-do list is always completely checked off, tax return is always early, and you understand all your financial accounts perfectly and where the money is going &#8211; it makes sense that you&#8217;d take a break and  relax with the TV news, or perhaps the Game of Thrones or the Xbox One.</p>
<p>If not, it would only seem logical to shut off this stream of interruptions and open up space for something else.</p>
<p><strong>But Mr. Money Mustache, I <em>Enjoy</em> These Things! Don&#8217;t take them away from me!</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the root of the problem, and the difference between an average life and a life of deep, radiant satisfaction.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter what you <em>enjoy. </em>It matters <em>what&#8217;s good for you. </em>I <em>enjoy</em> pumpkin cheesecake and key lime pie, but I only eat them a few times a year.</p>
<p>I also like salads, but let&#8217;s be honest, they are not on the same level as Pumpkin Cheesecake. My heart is beating faster just thinking about it right now. But I eat big salads twice a day.</p>
<p>Yet the salads deliver <em>much, much more happiness, </em>because they allow me to continue to run around and explore the world, climbing trees and jumping off rooftops, while the cheesecake would have me in stretch pants and an extra-wide golf cart seat.</p>
<p>It seems obvious when you put it in terms of food. But the same tradeoff applies with all sources of recreation and entertainment. You don&#8217;t have to be as compulsive as me, but you do have to make some changes to your habits, if you expect your life to change.</p>
<p>Now with all this puritan advice properly laid down, we can all relax and realize that there are no absolutes &#8211; <strong>life is a balance</strong>. There is plenty of room in life for both productive and unproductive activities. The problem is that <em>most</em> people have the balance tilted too far towards the latter.</p>
<p>So if your life needs a boost, try giving up something you enjoy, and replacing it with something that improves your life.</p>

<p>By this point you probably know all you ever wanted to know, and more, about Mr. Money Mustache&#8217;s long-ago path to early retirement. But my story is only one of an infinite number of possibilities, which means it is valuable to look around at how other people are doing it.</p>
<p>Because of that, I&#8217;ve been sharing more reader success stories recently, and I&#8217;ve been particularly excited to share this one for quite a while because it comes from a completely different direction.</p>
<p>I first met Zeona McIntyre just over two years ago, on a warm early summer day in Boulder. Without my knowledge she had created a Facebook group called Boulder Mustachians and already amassed a substantial collection of fun people before I even got word of it. We coordinated to hold a gathering in a beautiful riverside park downtown.</p>
<p>Late that night, after the main party and a smaller afterparty at a pub with a group of diehard survivors, the two of us were walking and talking the two miles across town to get Zeona back to her apartment, and me to the main road so I could bike back to Longmont. And she mentioned something vague and slightly mysterious about how much her life had changed, due to a new rental real estate business. I didn&#8217;t understand the details in full, but it sounded significant.</p>
<p>Fast forwarding to the almost-present, I encountered Zeona again. This time she was leading a session on real estate investing at the Camp Mustache Florida event in January*. By this point, she had the relaxed demeanor of an old pro. She owned at least four extremely profitable properties, bought at low prices and bringing in high rent due to the magic of AirBnb. She had more income and opportunities than she had time to think about. By my definition, she was already just about to hit semi-retirement at age 29, which means she had done it both younger and faster than I had.</p>
<p><em><div class="mmm-box"><strong>Note:</strong> I have enjoyed AirBnb for years, replacing bland, expensive hotels with more interesting local flavor for both personal and business travel. But I only recently learned from Zeona that they give out substantial travel credits to both traveler and friend via their referral program. So <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/c/petera2656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here&#8217;s my link for $40 off</span></strong></a> of your first AirBnb stay.</div></em></p>
<p>Since Zeona&#8217;s story combines a bunch of hard work, sound business principles, relatively fearless thinking and involved some techniques that had never even occurred to me before, I thought would we could all get some benefit of having a little conversation with her. So let&#8217;s see what she has to say:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>An Interview With the AirBnb Entrepreneur</strong></p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> Let&#8217;s start with a leading question on the basics first: your Mustachianism story. What was your financial and work life before you encountered this blog, what led you to it, and what changes did you make first?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> My mother got me interested in personal finance right around the time I headed to college. I remember being home on school breaks, watching The Suze Orman show with her and renting books like “Rich Dad, Poor Dad”, from the library. Although I had already begun to amass significant financial aid debt, I already had the concepts of snowball payments and index fund investing, ingrained in me early on.</p>
<p>Sometime around 2012 after stumbling across your blog a few times, I became convinced and converted to hardcore Mustachianism at the ripe ole’ age of 26. I didn’t know how I was going to retire by 30, but I held the vision fiercely.</p>
<p>At the time, I was in massage school, working at a dispensary for $12 per hour, with something like 50K+ of student debt left in a Parent Loan. So I started to bike everywhere, trained my friends to cook meals with me instead of going out to eat, started a massage practice in my living room, lived with my mom for a bit, and put every extra cent towards debt paydown.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> At some point you veered off the standard &#8220;work hard, save, invest&#8221; path and took a bigger jump into hosting a short-term rental as a source of income. Where did you get that idea?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> My best friend from high school was living the high life in New York City with a stressful career and an expensive apartment, then suddenly found himself laid off. At a friend’s suggestion, he decided to try renting it out on AirBnb while he went off to travel for a while before starting again. His little vacation turned into a year living in Spain and South Africa and by the end of it, he told me that he made $50,000 off renting his apartment!</p>
<p>I decided I had to try something similar for myself.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> What did your own AirBnB financial stuff look like initially? And from that point, how long did you let it ride and what did it feel like?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong><br />
First, a disclaimer: I stumbled into Airbnb during the earlier days of the platform and with no knowledge of the rules. These days, things with AirBnb are much more formal. So some of this stuff (renting out rooms from within a rented apartment) is a gray area.</p>
<p>I began my Airbnb journey in August 2012. My mother decided to move back to Hawaii, so I got a two bedroom apartment and a roommate who could help with rent. I furnished it with all the stuff my mom and I had, knowing that I could sublease it for more to a roommate if it was furnished and because I was curious about trying out Airbnb.</p>
<p>My new roomie was only around part-time, which allowed me to test the Airbnb waters a bit while she was living there (I gave her a cut) and then see if I wanted to get another roommate after she left. I never did.</p>
<p>I started by renting my room, renting hers when she was away, and renting both when she moved out. I would stay in whatever room wasn’t rented, stay with friends, basically whatever I had to do to make it work. I also did all the cleaning myself.</p>
<p>The rooms rented between $45-90/night each including the cleaning fee, and my portion of rent was only $575 so it covered it rather quickly. At the time, I had begun a massage practice by donation, out of my living room, which covered food/gas/bills and Airbnb covered my rent/utilities.</p>
<p>Luckily, I knew how to live frugally; I’m a bit shocked looking back at how little my earnings were to start and proud that I figured out a way to live job-free. I remember feeling so rich with freedom during that time in my life.</p>
<p>In September, after just a month of sampling AirBnb entrepreneurship, I knew I wanted to expand. So I took on a lease on a second apartment, furnished it in a weekend and I was off to the races. That place  was basically training wheels. I made a ton of mistakes and only made a couple hundred a month after expenses. And in December, a neighbor alerted the landlord to what turned out to be a violation of the lease policy, and he asked me to leave.</p>
<p>Although the apartment was relatively painless to dismantle and I got my entire deposit back, I was really shaken up from the experience and thought I might be done with the whole Airbnb experiment. Luckily, my father insisted that I pick myself up and try again, so I did.</p>
<p>My next place was a one bedroom condo that I was renting for $1025/mo, and this experience was much better. I averaged $500-1500/mo. profit from this location, while continuing to rent out rooms in my own home, going to school, doing all the turnover cleans, and doing some massages on the side. Although it sounds busy, it was really fun and flexible. Every day was different, and I only worked a couple of hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> What was the next step in the expansion? What tricks did you learn and use to make it successful?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> My experiences taught me that there was more profit to be made renting a home as a whole unit, instead of renting single rooms. At the same time, I found myself traveling more often, which forced me to seek out a cleaner that could cover me when I was away.</p>
<p>Looking back, this was a huge and somewhat obvious move towards expansion, and yet it took me awhile to realize. I was very focused on being a “true” mustachian: <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/09/13/domestic-outsourcing-practical-or-wussypants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not hiring out if it was something I could do myself</a>**. Although there is merit to this way of thinking, if you are attempting to scale up, at some point you have to let go and delegate.</p>
<p>I also tested a new vacation rentals software company that responded to guest inquiries/emails/questions if I was out of range for too long. This was the beginning of the automation that presently rules my business, and that same company is the one that I circled back to years later when I pushed to 5+ properties.</p>
<p>Although I mention specific settings that can be used to optimize your Airbnb listing on my blog, I don’t know if there are many “tricks” and I want to be clear in saying that I think it is a very accessible profession for anyone who might have an interest in hosting and hospitality. Thinking of it as a hospitality business rather than a turn-key real estate investment was a significant perspective shift I learned along the way. It is important to consider what sort of experience you are creating for the guest and how you can continually work towards improving that.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> Did you notice any significant change in your life, once you realized how different a semi-passive income like property rentals can be, when compared to a purely active income like a massage practice?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> Yes. In the Fall of 2012, just a few months after I started dabbling with Airbnb, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. I was pulled away by my mother’s illness and started taking multi-month leaves of absence to support her. Near the end of 2014, I knew I could no longer be away from home so I brought her back to Colorado to live with me.  The grief of losing my mother and one of the closest people in my life forced me into a sort of the “early retirement”. This is when Airbnb saved me, because the rentals were still working for me when I could not work myself.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> That’s a sad story, but I remember feeling the same way when <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/01/18/eulogy-to-another-great-dad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Dad</a> was on his way out last winter. It would have been much harder to make those international trips on short notice, and to deal with the sad times, if I also had to maintain a chipper and productive face, managing a team of software engineers back at the cube farm.</p>
<p>So anyway, as with any type of success, it takes a certain type of personality and skillset to build a successful business of this type. What general skills, traits, and unusual passions do you think you ended up having, which in retrospect are making this thing succeed.</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong><br />
<strong>1. Flexibility</strong>, I would say is the number one skill that really made this work. For years, any booking took priority over my plans. If someone was willing to pay for my house, I was out. I would either move over to my other apartment (I lived between two condos for 3+years) or stay with a friend. It sounds easy enough but it was ungrounding and quite exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>2. Organization</strong> &#8211; Scheduling multiple cleans and juggling bookings from multiple sites, gave me a crash course in building systems. My former weirdo obsession with spreadsheets helped me keep track of all my earnings / expenses.</p>
<p><strong>3. Optimization</strong> &#8211; I was careful not to waste time, resources, supplies, etc.</p>
<p><strong>4. Negotiation skills</strong> &#8211; Everything is life is negotiable: rent, airbnb rates, cleaner fees, etc. I did my best to maximize earnings.</p>
<p><strong>5. Communication skills</strong> &#8211; As a manager I really need to listen and keep a cool head. I am frequently responsible for sorting out the needs of guests, property owners, cleaners, you name it. I lean on the side of over-communicating, as I need to check in with everyone to make sure we are on the same page.</p>
<p><strong>6. Believing / Visualizing</strong> &#8211; I have a uniquely limitless outlook on life. I like to believe that anything I put my mind to is possible and I feel challenged rather than discouraged when someone tries to doubt me or project their limitations on me.</p>
<p><strong>7. Being a Risk-Taker</strong> &#8211; For as long as I can remember, I have had a large appetite for risk. The way I see it is that I am really thorough in doing my research and after checking out all the possible outcomes, things that look risky from the outside feel like a safe bet.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> What&#8217;s the current state of your operation?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> I now own four properties in St. Louis Missouri &#8211; single family houses purchased for an average of <strong>under $70,000 each</strong>. Plus an apartment in Boulder bought long ago for $162,000. On top of this, I manage another 10-20 properties for other property owners for a fee (a practice called co-hosting).</p>
<p>To handle it all, I have hired a team of several people: an assistant, receptionists, management software, cleaning teams, co-hosts working under me, etc. My goal is to take myself completely out of the picture.</p>
<p>After just a year of co-hosting other properties, my business went from $4,000-$6,000/mo. gross, to today, my biggest month to date: a whopping $18,000 (likely $13,000/net). I work about 8-10 hours a week now and I’m excited to ramp down.</p>
<p>Although I have built my business to a place of near automation, I am still called on sometimes and I have a few jobs left to outsource. I am happy to no longer be pulling the 40+ hour work weeks that I did for a few months during the build and I see Early Retirement coaxing me over to her spacious arms again.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> So what&#8217;s the future? Have you given up other sources of income? Faced an existential dilemma of what to do with your life if there is no point earning additional income?</p>
<p>I find that as the “earning and spending money” side of life becomes solved, it opens up a whole new can of worms. It can be a very joyful way to live, but you have to be careful because it also gives you the option of sitting around doing nothing, which is not joyful at all. Seen any pitfalls?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> The future is getting myself as close to full retirement as feasible, ASAP. I am still the big boss so I expect an occasional problem to come across my desk, and yet, I feel the key to happiness for myself is having the lowest amount of stress and responsibility on my plate as possible.</p>
<p>Last November, I finally gave up my massage practice in totality. It was strangely difficult to do. I was only making a couple hundred dollars a month and yet, it felt like some sort of safety net. Now, I am experiencing that same fear in letting go of taking on new clients myself (I defer them to my team for a smaller percentage) and running this Airbnb business directly. Although I have hit my “enough” number with my investments, transitions can be scary to make.</p>
<p>At the moment, I am looking forward to more space and time with myself. The two years that I spent essentially retired, gave me great practice at keeping myself entertained. I quickly realized that I had to find another way to derive meaning from my life than working or productivity. I was fortunate enough to find that being there for the people in my life gave me that.</p>
<p>I now travel nearly five months out of the year, have a good social circle and a lot of interests to keep me delighted for years to come. And the worst case scenario? I can always create some new business to tinker with down the road.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I see finding a compatible partner and creating a family as my next challenge to embark on, as well as developing creative pursuits. I really love writing. I would like more time to dedicate to my blog and am toying around with the idea of writing a book at my own leisurely pace. I am also quite terrified of public speaking, so the idea of doing a TEDx talk, sounds like a healthy way to confront that.</p>

<p><strong>MMM:</strong> One of the unusual things about you is the number of interesting trips you take. Can you tell us about some of the most interesting ones, and how this plays into the house-sitting and informal sharing economies?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> I just got back from a birthday month away. I dog sat in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands for 2.5 weeks, had a layover in NYC with some friends, sailed for a week in Greece, then caught up with a friend who just moved to Portugal and did a road trip in her Sprinter van from Lisbon to Porto.</p>
<p>I bought the flights with miles, stayed for free everywhere except on the boat, which I got on a half price, last minute tip; all while renting out my homes and car to support my eating out habits.</p>
<p>I guess you could say I am a poster child for the share economy. When I’m out in the world, I rent my car on turo and my homes on airbnb. I travel hack to cover the flights. Promote Airbnb for travel credits. I’m a huge fan of house/pet sitting which still seems to be underground and I use that method to stay in awesome homes for free (and sometimes even get paid) all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> Thinking about the bigger picture, what is your own definition of a life well lived, and what (if anything) do you think people in your peer group might be overlooking, if they don’t happen to encounter the right teachers early in life?</p>
<p><strong>ZM:</strong> I’m all about quality of life. I believe a life well lived is one with lots of love and laughter. People to hug, share delicious food with, and have adventures with. I believe creativity is born out of free time, which Americans especially are deficient in. I think it’s important to spend a lot of time in nature and with the unique opportunity of discovering yourself. The real work is within. I find that people especially my age, are so distracted with things outside of themselves / needing to prove something.</p>
<p>The biggest set back I see around me is limiting beliefs. I see a lot of people telling themselves old stories that keep them stuck in patterns that aren’t serving them. I really enjoy sharing my experiences to show others what is possible. I think the biggest compliment I can ever receive is that I inspired someone, if I’ve done that for even one person, my job is complete. Nothing I’ve done in my career is out of reach to the average person, you’ve just got to believe.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> Thanks for sharing your life with us Zeona!</p>

<p><em>*Yes, you may be noticing a one-dimensional theme to my social life these days, but hey, it&#8217;s hard to beat Mustachians if you&#8217;re looking for interesting people to hang out with.</em></p>
<p><em>**For the record, Zeona was actually being totally Mustachian here &#8211; hiring employees to expand a profitable business. My policy is that you&#8217;re not allowed to hire people just to facilitate your own convenience and consumption at home, because you could probably benefit from the extra exercise and learning &#8211; along with the extra money.</em></p>

<p>Almost exactly six years ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/15/mustache-on-the-move-the-evil-mister-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple post about a pawn shop</a> opening up in my town. It was during the very early days of this blog, and I figured it was an easy way to take some shots at that financially predatory industry. Also, the shop was called Mister Money, which had an ironic similarity to my own name, Mr. Money Mustache.</p>
<p>So anyway, in that post I joked that I was going to buy the building next door, and if anyone walked into <em>my</em> shop trying to borrow money, I&#8217;d PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE and tell them to embrace frugality and sensible living, rather than high-interest borrowing, as the solution to their financial problems. For some reason, this idea of the &#8220;Face Punch&#8221; really stuck with the early readers, and became a bit of a brand for MMM.</p>
<p>As sheer coincidence would have it, in early March 2017 a cryptic ad appeared in the local Craigslist.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><div class="mmm-box">Commercial building for sale, $230000</div></p>
<p>There was an address, but no pictures and no other information.</p>
<p>I recognized the address as being right next door to my pawn shop rival.  And we recognized the price as being <strong>about half</strong> of what a small single-family house or commercial building goes for around here these days. Mrs. Money Mustache was the one who first found the ad, so she called the number.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, the building was a <em>severely </em>run-down joint, but with extremely good potential. A dozen species of insects and animals called its rotting exterior woodwork their home and three dumpsters worth of demolition, debris and dead trees clogged the property*.</p>
<p>But at the core was a 2400 square foot brick and concrete structure, plus a detached 2-car garage, on an immense 7500 square foot lot, directly across the street from a recently-built $23 million building which happens to host one of the town&#8217;s <a href="http://visitlongmont.org/longs-peak-pub-taphouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best pubs</a>.</p>
<p>The reason it was so cheap, aside from decades of neglect, is that it was owned by a charming man in his 70s who now lives hundreds of miles away. Once a prominent owner of significant chunks of Longmont, he was unloading this last forgotten scrap of real estate just to get it out of his hair. Perhaps he was unfamiliar with the recent boom in our property prices here, and he was definitely unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/06/20/how-to-sell-a-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern property marketing techniques</a> (he had relied on a friend to even get the ad onto Craigslist). The building had been in constant use by a series of retail tenants, but nobody had had much of an incentive to fix the place up.</p>
<p>I called him later that night with an all-cash offer, and after an hour of telling me amazing stories of his life, he accepted it.  A few weeks later, we closed on the property and then I spent the next few months in a full-bore restoration process &#8211; a multi-person vortex of flying sparks, brick, sawdust, beer, diesel, sweat, blood, and beer.</p>
<div id="attachment_14209" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-14209" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix-1024x542.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="312" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix-1024x542.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix-200x106.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix-300x159.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix-768x406.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix-150x79.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix-900x476.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/door-fix.jpg 1467w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1: Replacing the Infinitely Shitty &#8220;doors&#8221; to the back yard and future patio, with a reasonably fancy unit I rescued from another builder via Craigslist. I also added some foam insulation and some repurposed siding &#8211; leftover materials and design ideas from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/01/24/diy-studio-building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backyard studio</a> project. Just one of about 100 similar-scale improvements this building needed.</p></div>
<p><strong>So Why Did We Buy a Building?</strong></p>
<p>This somewhat wild scheme is the culmination of a few different values:</p>
<ul>
<li>We wanted to get more involved with the local community, by owning a little piece of the Main Street and helping to make it a more joyful place. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with selling stuff and making money, but I&#8217;m also interested in teaching classes, hosting events and parties, and donating the space for use for non-profit events which are designed to help people. <strong>(See the bottom of this article to learn about the first one)</strong></li>
<li>Mrs. MM and a good friend of hers both have booming <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/03/06/etsy-shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etsy shops</a> that are ready to break out into the real world. They enjoy working together so much, that they decided owning a building together was the next logical step. So both women, and both of us husbands, teamed up together and split the building equally.</li>
<li>From a financial perspective, it would be hard to go wrong because we got the place for such a low price. The land alone is worth more than the $225k purchase price, and if the town continues its current downtown boom, this could increase drastically again over the next ten years. Since the structure includes 2-3 separately rentable spaces, the property could easily bring in $3000-$4000 per month of income (after renovations) if we chose to rent it out in the future. And there were no banks or borrowing involved, so the stress and closing costs were low, and flexibility is high.</li>
</ul>
<p>But all those points are just the &#8220;pretend responsible adult&#8221; justifications. In real life, we bought this thing because it seems like a fun adventure.</p>
<p>As this blog has grown so unexpectedly over the years it has presented all sorts of opportunities. As prestigious as they sound, they really all boil down to either spending more time on airplanes, or more time or sitting at the computer, and always less time being here for my son. I don&#8217;t really need more fake lifestyle guru nonsense in my life &#8211; I want more great stuff going on right here in our own community.</p>
<p>So, as the headline suggests, I&#8217;m outfitting half of this building to become the MMM World Headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens at MMM WHQ?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_14219" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hoist.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-14219" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hoist-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="546" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hoist-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hoist-135x180.jpg 135w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hoist-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hoist-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hoist.jpg 863w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We found lots of cool ancient brick under the other coverings. Here&#8217;s a scene from when I was trying out the new drywall hoist to install the kitchen ceiling.</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided that my side of the building will become a coworking and hangout space for Longmont-area Mustachian Entrepreneurs. It will be membership-based, with only 50 memberships made available at a price of $50 per month. And for the price of membership, locals get:</p>
<ul>
<li>24/7 keycard access to a big, open room downtown (about 700 square feet) with couches, tables, benches, stylish design, etc. Plus an adjoining small kitchen area for our food.</li>
<li>access to 49 other accomplished entrepreneurial local friends, who can all be part of an active <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack Group</a>.</li>
<li>WiFi over Gigabit fiber internet access</li>
<li>Free or cheap coffee and fitness-friendly snacks</li>
<li>Tool sharing library</li>
<li>A big outdoor patio courtyard area out back with grill, chairs, speakers, patio lanterns, etc.</li>
<li>Outdoor gym with barbells, squat rack, and bodyweight things like pull-up bars, etc.</li>
<li>Garage workshop with welding and metalworking equipment</li>
<li>Beer brewing setup with permanent kegerator &#8211; members with skill in craft brewing can rotate through to produce guest batches. Ideally, this will provide free beer at all times.</li>
<li>Bike fixing station, parts inventory and swapping, helping each other improve skills</li>
<li>Talks and classes &#8211; from members, and from visitors.</li>
<li>Group Advocacy for improving the town.</li>
<li>The chance to work together on this new building &#8211; learning through doing as we build new features. (I&#8217;ve already got all the equipment for a 3.6 kW solar energy system ready to install onto the garage roof when we&#8217;re ready)</li>
<li>And any other perks and cool ideas we can think of with our collective mind power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although $50 per month sounds awfully cheap for all of this, it should actually work out great &#8211; paying the taxes and utilities and easily pumping out a monthly surplus to use for continued improvements, tools, supplies, etc. I reserve the right to make a profit off of the place eventually, but obviously this is not my main motivation &#8211; otherwise I&#8217;d charge a more &#8220;normal&#8221; coworking membership rate or just stay home and crank out blog articles.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in joining, read <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/hq-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this rough agreement</a> then send me an email through the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact form</a> with &#8220;Coworking&#8221; in the title. If you end up as a member, I will put you onto a shared Google Doc list and the slack group so we can all start talking. (Please include some biographical background to help me determine that you&#8217;re a real, friendly person!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The primary members will generally live within biking distance since I don&#8217;t want anyone to sign up for a mandatory <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/04/22/curing-your-clown-like-car-habit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">car commute</a>. But if you want to become a patron or long distance member &#8211; contributing to the cause and working remotely with the core members (perhaps just to gain access to such a cool group, stop in whenever you <em>are</em> in the area and see your money put to use for interesting hactivism here in Longmont), send me a email with &#8220;Patron&#8221; &#8211; we could probably still keep a close-knit group with up to 10 such members.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Important: </strong>Although the building now hosts frequent meetups and other events, please do not just show up at random time unannounced as part of your cross-country roadtrip. Instead, just attend an event if the timing happens to align.</em></p>
<p><em> I feel strange adding this note, but travelers have been stopping by almost every day and as much as I love Mustachians, giving tours to unexpected visitors make it difficult to get work done &#8211; which is the kind of the point of a coworking space during the day.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, the Northern entrance is &#8220;Mud and Madder&#8221;, the future handcrafted shop owned by Mrs. MM and a friend which is not part of my HQ.</em></p>
<p><strong>Are you Ready?</strong></p>

<p>The space is almost ready and the first philanthropic event is already booked: I&#8217;m hosting my friend Alan Donegan&#8217;s UK-based <strong><a href="http://www.popupbusinessschool.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop-Up Business School</a></strong> for their inaugural US event in early September and it&#8217;s <strong>for everyone &#8211; not just members!</strong></p>
<p>You can sign up here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.popupbusinessschool.co.uk/longmont.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>http://www.popupbusinessschool.co.uk/longmont.html</strong></span></a></p>
<p>This is a nine-day class on Mustachian-style entrepreneurship: how to start a business with minimal initial investment and a quick path to cashflow.</p>
<p>Members of the Longmont community** and the coworking space will get first dibs at the tickets, which are are actually worth about $500 each but offered for <strong>free</strong> due to a unique business model.</p>
<p>(huh?)</p>
<p>Pop-up business school is intended to help <em>anyone</em> &#8211; well-established or just scraping by &#8211; start a business. Because this is such a powerful way to improve lives and communities, as Pop-Up Business School&#8217;s repuation has grown, Alan and company have been able to attract outside funding. City councils, philanthropic foundations, and companies.</p>
<p>So I tried the same thing here for the US debut &#8211; inviting a few unusually cool companies that are run by people that understand our mission around here. Almost all of them said yes and chipped in a substantial chunk of money, directly to Pop-up business school. So in thanks I&#8217;d like to mention them here:</p>

<p>In short, today&#8217;s situation is very similar to what Mr. Money Mustache, despite no magical forecasting skill, forecast back in 2013, in an article called &#8220;<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/05/07/how-to-prosper-in-an-economic-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Prosper in an Economic Boom</a>&#8220;. In that post, I suggested that we were in for some <em>very </em>good years, which made it a good time for getting ahead &#8211; make hay while the sun shines!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot easier to fix your problems <em>right now, </em>with a stiff economic tailwind at your back, than it will be in just a couple of short years (or less?) when the high seas and lighting bolts and whirlpools are ripping at your pockets. Fair weather preparations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rake in your big paycheck while it lasts and don&#8217;t blow it on temporary luxuries</li>
<li>Keep your living footprint efficient &#8211; in expensive cities this is a great time to rent, and not a great time to spring for the sprawling home of your dreams on a big mortgage.</li>
<li>Eliminate any last shreds of consumer and <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/05/06/sofi-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">student loan debt</a></li>
<li>With the stock market at higher price-to-earnings ratio than usual, there is less harm in paying off your mortgage earlier, keeping six months of living expenses in cash or money market funds, and other non-stock investments like rental properties in low-cost cities (where reliable rent is over 1% of total property price per month).</li>
<li>Design your career and your self-employment side gigs so that they are resilient: multiple streams of income from different sources, and an easy answer for &#8220;What would I do if my job or industry ceased to exist?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, becoming less dependent on a steady job is always a good thing &#8211; it just happens to be much easier to build that independence if you&#8217;re surfing atop a giant economic wave like this one.</p>
<p><strong>So, Here We Go:</strong></p>
<p>With all those preparations in progress, I hope you&#8217;re ready, because there&#8217;s a recession on the way.</p>
<p>I can say this with confidence because there&#8217;s <em>always</em> a recession coming &#8211; we just never know exactly when. About the only thing I can guarantee is that we are <strong>about four years closer</strong> to the next recession than we were when I wrote that optimistic earlier article.</p>
<p>But it is very important to remind yourself of this, because when we get to this rosy point of the business cycle, things have been so good for so long that we  forget that crashes are even possible. If you&#8217;re a sagely 27 years old right now, you may have never experienced a recession in your adult life &#8211; all you have ever seen is the good times. You&#8217;re in for an interesting surprise.</p>
<p>However, on top of that folksy &#8220;It always happens&#8221; wisdom, there are a few other clues that suggest the time is approaching:</p>
<p>Household debt levels <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-16/us-household-debt-rose-126-trillion-2016-biggest-jump-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have risen</a> back to their pre-crash peak, and with an even worse composition: more student loans, and a record level of <strong>auto loans</strong>, the most ridiculous and self-destructive piece of personal finance outside of mortgaging your shins to a loan shark to afford tonight&#8217;s cocaine.</p>
<div id="attachment_14137" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-14137 size-full" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/debt-composition-2_0.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="368" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/debt-composition-2_0.jpg 500w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/debt-composition-2_0-200x147.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/debt-composition-2_0-300x221.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/debt-composition-2_0-150x110.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image from the very good Zero Hedge article linked above.</p></div>
<p>Consumer debt shouldn&#8217;t really exist at all &#8211; it&#8217;s simply a house of cards that allows impatient people to pull their consumption from the future, just a teeeeny bit forward into the present, in exchange for spectacularly bad costs, stress, and wrecking of lives. But because it exists and is profitable, a huge ($1.3 trillion in 2015) financial industry has sprung up to originate, multiply, and churn this debt.</p>
<p>Just like 2007, the financial industry is on top of the world again, with lots of easy money flying around into things like &#8220;subprime auto loans&#8221;. The Great Recession of that era was caused when the wild packaging and reselling of mortgage debt combined with a false sense of confidence that the party would go on forever.</p>
<p>The final piece of evidence comes from just how long the present party has gone on. If you look at the history of economic expansions &#8211; how long we have gone since the last recession &#8211; we are currently enjoying the third longest one in history:</p>
<div id="attachment_14158" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/expansions-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-14158" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/expansions-1.jpg" alt="" width="589" height="358" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/expansions-1.jpg 776w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/expansions-1-200x122.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/expansions-1-300x182.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/expansions-1-768x467.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/expansions-1-150x91.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When we put all Good Times since WW2 into a graph, you can see just how exceptionally long we have been riding high.</p></div>
<p>So we&#8217;ve had a good run. If we go on to tie the Clinton-era record, that still gives us a maximum of two years until the trouble hits. And if you happen to think that economic success correlates with the level of brainpower currently in the White House, then, hmm.. you can make some adjustments based on that as well.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;OK, But What Actually Causes Recessions? And What will Cause the Next One?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>In succinct terms, recessions are caused when a bunch of people lose confidence all at once.</p>
<p>Usually it starts with a mini-crisis: the prices of stocks and houses have been going up for so long that people forget the opposite can happen. A bunch of testosterone-fueled betting and speculation (often by overconfident and under-regulated junior hotshots on Wall Street) ensues. And in general, speculation is a dumb thing.</p>
<p>If you have ever heard of someone buying something, not because they actually want it or because it produces income, but just because they think it will be worth even more in the future, that&#8217;s speculation. When people buy apartments in Toronto and leave them vacant (or rent them out at a loss) in hopes of later selling them to an even <a href="http://www.greaterfool.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greater Fool</a>, that&#8217;s speculation. Speculation leads to bubbles, and bubbles always pop, because there was no rational reason for the prices to get that high in the first place. They also happen frequently in the stock market.</p>
<p>When prices hit some random limit or wobble a bit, the bubble often pops. Everyone gets scared and rushes out to sell, so the prices drop rapidly. Suddenly, over-leveraged novices can&#8217;t repay their oversized bank loans and they start missing payments.</p>
<p>Banks get scared of losing all that money, so they tighten up lending, which causes businesses to scale back hiring and expansion, leading to layoffs, which cuts down on consumer spending, which cuts down business profits again, leading to even more layoffs, and the problem feeds upon itself.</p>
<p>Eventually, the prices of these valuable assets gets low enough that people with <em>actual money </em>like you and me perk up and start scooping them up at a discount. A pristine apartment building here, some shares of a few thousand established, profitable companies there via an index fund. This puts a floor under the dropping prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank also steps in, lowering interest rates and flooding the system with cheap money to encourage people to start buying houses again and businesses to start expanding to soak up the pool of unemployed people. Everyone gets back to work, and the recession ends. Usually very quickly &#8211; most recessions last less than one year.</p>
<p>So, as long as you aren&#8217;t a Consumer Sucka, commuting to work in a bank-financed gas-powered racing sofa and/or borrowing money for furniture and appliances to outfit that last spare room in your suburban mansion, recessions are a great thing. Housing and profitable investments become cheaper, insanity and speculation is reset, and people actually start living more frugally again, getting back to the roots of what living a good life really means.</p>
<p>Most people who are wealthy <em>today</em>, achieved it by building and acquiring profitable investments <em>in the past</em>, when they were on sale.  A recession is just a big sale &#8211; on almost everything.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;So, Should I Be Worried?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>No, of course not! This is just money we&#8217;re talking about, and you should <em>never</em> be worried about money.</p>
<p>One of the joys of Mustachianism is that it makes you immune to the business cycle. You immediately stop living beyond your means, so you have stepped back from the cliff. Then you start to build a resilient mesh of skills, health, money, friendships, and peaceful personal badassity which further protect you from trouble.</p>
<p>After all:  who cares about the price of gasoline, or affording cholesterol pills, or how to make the next truck payment, when you&#8217;re a wiry and muscular Mustachian, riding your swift and sensible bike a few miles to work and banking almost all of your enormous paycheck every two weeks?</p>
<p>Then as you live this joyful existence for however many years it takes, the final stage of complete financial independence arrives automatically, and you are absolutely invincible.</p>
<p>Whether it comes in two weeks or four years, I hope all of us are prepared for next hill on this roller coaster &#8211; it&#8217;s a lot more fun when you know it&#8217;s coming.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><em>In the comments: do you care for a wager on when the next &#8220;crisis&#8221; will hit and we&#8217;ll fall into recession again? What will be the thing that gets us this time?</em></p>

<p>In this extremely wealthy country of ours, the chief barrier to wealth is often the information, or <em>mis</em>information that gets stuck inside our own heads.</p>
<p>People with the right knowledge can develop the right habits, and these habits lead them to accumulate wealth very quickly. Meanwhile, the majority of people pick up incorrect financial ideas and bad habits, leading to permanent debt. But they mingle mostly with their own type, so the failure habits keep spreading.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, to break out of the Herd Mediocrity Mindset, you just need to see an example to learn what is possible.</strong></p>
<p>So with that in mind, let&#8217;s review an example of yet another allegedly completely impossible thing, that an MMM reader is doing every day.</p>
<p>Jeremy Stone, aka The Rock, engages in a rare &#8211; and yet incredibly profitable &#8211; activity, in a city that is legendary (in the public mind, anyway) for making this activity completely impossible.</p>
<p>The following tale is drawn from our past year of occasional email conversations.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Lawyer Who Actually Bikes to Work.<br />
Year-Round. In Houston.</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Dear Mr. Money Mustache,<br />
</strong></em><br />
<em><div class="mmm-box">&#8220;I’m a lawyer and commute to downtown Houston every day regardless of weather (unless I need to drive somewhere for work), without a handy shower or any special amenities, so it can definitely be done.</em></p>
<p><em>I was skeptical too, but my wife pushed me to do it after we got into your blog about 4 years ago, and it’s been one of the best decisions we’ve made.  If anyone complains that they can’t do it because of heat, humidity, needing to dress in a suit, etc, I’m proof that you can do it.&#8221;</div></em></p>
<h3><strong>The Challenge:</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout the history of this blog, Houston has become the poster child of Bike Excusitis Disease &#8211; the place most often cited as &#8220;The Reason I Can&#8217;t Bike to Work&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_14092" style="width: 437px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-14092" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/houston-traffic.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="326" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/houston-traffic.jpg 640w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/houston-traffic-200x153.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/houston-traffic-300x229.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/houston-traffic-150x115.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Houston commuting, as perceived by car drivers (image credit: Politico)</p></div>
<p>Raised on the slippery black teat of the Almighty Oil Well, Houston was developed for motor vehicles and the metro area now sprawls across <strong>ten thousand square miles</strong> (6.4 million acres), which means Houston alone is one fifth the size of the country of England. Ironically, the more you optimize a city for cars, the bigger your traffic jams, so Houston has the worst traffic in the US.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a subtropical steam bath: daily highs exceed 80F / 27C for a <em>full nine months of the year</em> with high humidity year-round.</p>
<p>On top of that, Mr. Stone is a high-ranking official in a law firm, the profession most often cited as one where you can&#8217;t bike to work. Lawyers need to wear suits at work, see clients, impress judges, and this calls for the utmost in personal hygeine &#8211; scrubbed skin, shaved beards, polished shoes and manicured nails, premium brands and styled haircuts. It&#8217;s a hassle, but it is a necessary selling of the soul, in exchange for a six or seven figure income. Right?</p>
<p>With those painful complaints out of the way, we might as well move on to actually solving our problem.</p>
<p><em><div class="mmm-box">&#8220;At first, I thought it was a crazy idea. It wasn&#8217;t, and I loved it. </em></p>
<p><em>I started commuting on an old but good Trek mountain bike (got stolen), then to a $50 hybrid that was a piece of crap, then upgraded to a fancy Surly Disc Trucker. </em></p>
<p><em>Most of this route is nice and easy, because it is mostly on a hike/bike trail. Over the last few years, Houston has been changing old railroad lines into these trails.&#8221;</div></em></p>
<h3><strong>The Route: </strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_14091" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-14091" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="506" height="380" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-900x675.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Downtown-sunrise-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunrise in Downtown Houston, as seen from the bike route.</p></div>
<p>Bike commuting can be superior to driving in <em>every</em> city, but only when you design a route that works for riding your bike. When you drive a car, you will usually end up on the fastest, widest, (and most dangerous) roads, never even realizing that there were parallel bike-friendly options nearby.</p>
<div id="attachment_14099" style="width: 568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-14099" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood-1024x650.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="354" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood-1024x650.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood-300x190.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood-768x487.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood-900x571.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fancyhood.jpg 1163w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>&#8220;My route takes me through a neighborhood called River Oaks, where the very richest Houstonians have lived for decades.&#8221;</em></p></div>
<p>Early in our conversation, Mr. Stone shared a map of his bike route with me, and I compared it to Google&#8217;s suggested route for driving a car downtown. The distance is about the same, but in a car you end up on the interstate highway, which makes the commute seem completely un-bikeable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-14088 size-full" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="811" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1.jpg 1300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1-300x187.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1-768x479.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1-1024x639.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route1-900x561.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></a></p>
<p>Fig.1: Google Maps view of car vs. bike routes to work. Bikes are surprisingly fast, plus immune to traffic jams and you get free parking.</p>
<p><strong>Key Strategy Note:</strong> this ride was made much easier by the fact that Stone lives within 4 miles of work. This didn&#8217;t happen by accident: he chose his home and his work strategically to avoid a car clown commute.</p>
<p>Yet interestingly enough, houses in his neighborhood are still only in the $300,000s. If homes so close in are so affordable, <em>why</em> is <em>anyone</em> commuting into downtown Houston in a car?</p>
<p>There is no answer aside from sheer foolishness &#8211; those highways will soon be empty after this article gets out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><div class="mmm-box"></em><em>&#8220;My route takes me along the trail along Silver St. in an old Warehouse district, now an artsy district. Then along White Oak Bayou (Houston is built on bayous, not rivers!) as you near downtown, and under an old 150 year old bridge that has been built over. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Some of these bridges serve as homes for the thousands and thousands of bats here. You can&#8217;t see them, but I took this picture at about 6 or 630 am, and there were bats flying all around. The bridge is so low you get to ride right through them!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Biking beats driving &#8211; exercise, fun, no traffic, bats, tombs, turtles, snakes, herons!&#8221;</div></em></p>
<h3><strong>The Speed: </strong></h3>
<p>The deceptive thing about bikes is that within a city, your average speed ends up equal to, or even faster than, a car. In big cities, cars average <a href="http://infinitemonkeycorps.net/projects/cityspeed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only about 27 MPH</a> even without traffic, and rush hour can <strong>cut this speed in half again</strong>. Meanwhile, a slow beach cruiser coasts at about 12MPH (the speed Google uses for biking estimates), a fit cyclist rolls at 20, and an electric bike can easily sustain 28 MPH with almost no effort from your legs at all.</p>
<p>So when I&#8217;m in a rush to get somewhere in town, I never reach for the car keys &#8211; there&#8217;s no time to waste puttering around in a gas-powered wheelchair.</p>
<h3><strong>The Cars (and other Financial Effects):</strong></h3>
<p>Most people in Mr. Stone&#8217;s position have huge houses in the wealthy enclaves of Houston, and drive very high-end cars to work. If there is a spouse and family in the picture, they have multiple cars. And yet somehow, the Stone family survives with just one 2006 Honda CRV (market value about $6000), which remains in great condition because it leads such an easy life.</p>
<p>Driven lightly, the total cost of ownership of a car like this is about $2000 per year. Meanwhile, the typical attorney power couple might keep an up-to-date Mercedes SUV and a BMW 5-series. Driven at the US average level of 13,000 miles per year, this fleet would vaporize about <strong>$24,000 per year</strong> of personal wealth.</p>
<p>Wow, we need to put that shit into a box so more people will see it:</p>
<p><strong><div class="mmm-box"></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Average family driving<br />
with two typical lawyer-level cars<br />
destroys about $250,000 of your wealth<br />
every single decade.</strong></p>
<p><strong></div></strong></p>
<p>Still think biking to work is only for poor people? Do you consider an 11-year-old vehicle beneath your standards?</p>
<p>When you are not dependent on cars, you no longer derive your identity from them, which means you can start thinking about them like the appliances they really are. This makes your car costs drop drastically.</p>
<h3><strong>But What if I Move Jobs?</strong></h3>
<p>Coincidentally, halfway through our conversation, Stone ended up switching employers and acquiring an even better position.</p>
<p>I imagine that the same sharp mind and optimistic can-do attitude that encouraged him to bike to work, were the things that helped him earn this upgrade. But the new office was in a different part of town, further from home.</p>
<p>Did The Rock head straight to the car dealership to purchase a new Chevrolet Suburban like everyone else in Houston? No, of course, he just busted out the map and the brainpower again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14101" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2-1024x711.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="396" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2-1024x711.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2-200x139.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2-300x208.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2-768x533.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/route2-900x625.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>But What About the Heat?</strong></h3>
<p><em><div class="mmm-box">&#8220;Until the new job, my office did not have any shower facilities. But I found it was not really a problem: I just keep my clean dress clothes at work, and change out of my cycling clothes once I get to the office. </em></p>
<p><em>Also, making the trip before sunrise (especially in the summer) gives me much cooler temperatures. The ride home can be hot and sunny, but there is always a cool shower and air conditioning waiting for me when I arrive.&#8221;</div></em></p>
<p>Rock is right. I too biked to school and work throughout my career, in temperatures ranging from 0F to 105F. Long-time readers already know that bike transportation is probably the biggest factor that accelerated, and continues to fuel, my own family&#8217;s early retirement.</p>
<p>Some of my workplaces had showers, and others didn&#8217;t &#8211; but I never even felt the need to use them. In extreme heat I&#8217;d just just put on a clean, dry shirt and maybe a fresh layer of speed stick, and settle in to my office to enjoy the air conditioning. Any trace of perspiration or heat was gone within about five minutes.</p>
<p>This is because physical activity, including riding your bike, is <em>normal, </em>not the exception. It&#8217;s not a medical procedure or a competition or something you do in an indoor &#8220;spinning&#8221; class. It&#8217;s not an emergency condition which causes your body to shoot feces from every pore, destroying any nearby pieces of clothing and requiring a long, hot shower every time you move so much as a fingertip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just what happens every day.  So The Rock and I will see you on the streets tomorrow morning &#8211; it&#8217;s always Bike to Work Day.</p>

It either went up, or <em>way</em> up, depending on how you want to account for things.</p>
<p>Every year, this annual report seems to come out a little bit later &#8211; mostly because I&#8217;m no longer all that interested in how much money we spend. And Mrs. Money Mustache, my faithful assistant in creating these reports in past years, has disappeared completely from the blog &#8211; justifiably more interested in her <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/03/06/etsy-shop/">Etsy Shop</a></span> than family finances. Such is the nature of retirement.</p>
<p>If you are early on in your journey to financial freedom, <strong>you should not do what we are doing. </strong>Until you have your finances on auto-pilot so that you are saving 50-75% of your income, you should absolutely be reviewing every piece of spending and adding up all the categories.</p>
<p><strong>(<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/01/26/calculating-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Related Article: How Rich are You? How to find your Net Worth and Savings Rate</a>)</strong></p>
<p>But we&#8217;re all done saving for retirement. Our cash outflows feel both luxurious and reasonable, and they are well below the retirement income budget, so it seems less and less necessary to measure them.</p>
<p>After all, if you are happy with your body composition, do you still need to keep measuring every calorie you eat? If your breathing is clear and uninterrupted, do you track your annual number of breaths?</p>
<p>But our Supposedly Low Spending has kind of become my brand. And because of that, there are even <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/forumwelcome-to-the-forum/mmm-2015-spending/">conspiracy theories</a> that form around this spending:</p>
<p><em><div class="mmm-box"><strong>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s making that much money and only spending $25k.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Oh, looky there.. Mustache <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/04/so-i-bought-an-electric-car/">bought an electric car</a> as an &#8220;experiment&#8221;. I wonder if that will show up on their annual spending!&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;How much of his [travel/entertainment/home renovation/marijuana] expenses is he hiding from us as business expenses?&#8221;</strong></div></em></p>
<p>So I thought I could do things a little differently this year. I can share the normal family expenditures as well what our businesses spent, and everything in between.</p>
<p><strong>The Basic Expenses</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the familiar chart, updated for 2016, complete with last year&#8217;s numbers for comparison.</p>

<p><strong>So What is Mr. Money Mustache Hiding From Us?</strong></p>
<p>In a word: Nothing &#8211; this is my best guess at what our true expenses would be, if we lived a normal, retired life.</p>
<p>But here are the exceptions and special situations, which you can account for however you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher Income is forcing me to pay full-price for health insurance. Health insurance pricing comes on a sliding scale from &#8220;nearly free&#8221; below $25,000 in family income, up to full price for incomes over $80,000 (<a href="http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/">see subsidy calculator</a>)</li>
<li>But then again, our family business (of which we are employees) pays these premiums on our behalf, so they are pretty painless</li>
<li>I built <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/01/24/diy-studio-building/">this nifty studio</a>, spending about $30,000 in the process. Is it spending, or investment? Since it increases the value of the house by much more than that amount, and I <em>will </em>be selling this house and moving somewhere else eventually, I chose to treat it as investment. On the other hand, spending money on repairs, changing paint colors, gardens, or swimming pools would count as spending to me, since these items are more likely to be recurring and/or not recouped at the time of sale.</li>
<li>I bought a Nissan Leaf for roughly $14,000 after all costs. This was $9,000 more than I got for selling the old Scion xA. Is this spending? Well, I definitely would not have bought it if it weren&#8217;t for the blog (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-buy-a-35000-brand-new-electric-car-for-under-14000-2016-11-02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it served as a strong form of advocacy</a>) and I think it may have actually made a <a href="http://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noticeable difference</a> in US Leaf sales numbers &#8211; which was my main purpose. Sure <em>is </em>a nice car, but we barely use cars for personal purposes (I had to become an Uber driver in order to even get enough drive time to properly test the car!)</li>
<li>In late 2016, I <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/26/notes-on-giving-away-100000/">gave away $100,000</a> of this blog&#8217;s income to various charities, with much more to come. Having a business that makes and gives away money probably reduces the need to give away my real retirement savings.</li>
<li>Travel as Mr. Money Mustache (trips to Ecuador, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and a couple of other places) added up to about $4,000 between flights, hotels and food. None of this is stuff I would have done for personal fun, but it <em>may</em> have burned me out enough that I skipped or missed other personal trips (camping, etc) that would have increased my travel spending.</li>
<li>Mrs. Money Mustache&#8217;s Etsy shop spent more than $20,000 on materials, shipping, tools, etc. Most of this went right back out the door and earned a profit, but you could argue that both of our business expense accounts satisfied our &#8220;spending desire&#8221;, displacing personal spending in some way. In fact, writing for <em>you </em>consumes so much of my limited free time, that it may prevent me from expanding into other, more expensive hobbies (like upgrading my mountain bike or snowboard gear).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it looks like another fairly reasonable year. The biggest lesson that I try to emphasize is that spending does <em>not </em>have to scale with income. We <strong>spent less than 10% of our taxable income</strong> this year, and still cannot see any reason to inflate the lifestyle any further than it is already.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful life!</p>

Contracts.</p>
<p>Contracts, paperwork, and bureaucracy. Guarantees, warranties, and excessive caution in an attempt to ensure a trouble-free future. Not all of it is bullshit, but the older I get, the more I realize that a surprising portion of it is.</p>
<p>I mean sure, if I&#8217;m Tesla and you are Panasonic, and we&#8217;re partnering to build the world&#8217;s largest structure and produce the majority of the world&#8217;s energy storage products, and we each have thousands of employees involved in the process, we can write up a contract and sign it.</p>
<p>But if I invite you over to my house for one of our customary Sunset Beers in the Park events tonight, how appropriate would it be for me to send along a little PDF contract with five places for you to sign?</p>
<p><em><div class="mmm-box">I, Jane Mustachian, agree to arrive at the Mustache residence between 5 and 6PM, and consume between 1 and 5 servings of beer and/or wine, over a period not to exceed six (6) hours, to convey myself to and from the event using only muscle-powered transportation&#8230; blah blah any food served may or may not contain nuts or gluten&#8230; agree to not to hold Mustache family liable for any injuries..  and so on.</div></em></p>
<p>You&#8217;d think I was crazy, and find another place to have your beer tonight.</p>
<p>We understand this at the social level, and even at the small business level, if we feel a high level of <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/06/11/get-rich-with-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trust</a>. But as soon as we lose our trust and get overly fearful, we start breaking out the lawyers and the contracts and the stifling formality.</p>
<p>It is at this point, I argue, that life starts to suck.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the point at which a company starts to suck &#8211; that moment when it loses its soul and its freewheeling joy, and starts pushing for profits above ethics, and the lower level employees are not empowered to do what they know is right because their boss would have to ask the next level boss and the request would die before it reached someone with enough authority.</p>
<p>This is also the point at which I try to avoid doing business with a company if at all practical, and find a smaller one who could use a new customer.</p>
<p>And therefore I think we can make our lives better if we <strong>raise that threshold of fear a little bit</strong>, and start running our businesses and our lives as if we were big boys and girls.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another story which illustrates this point:</p>
<p>On the &#8220;contact&#8221; section of this website, I have a little note that says people should <em>not</em> email me with requests for marketing partnerships, TV shows, book publishing, etc. Through experience I learned that those activities not nearly as fun as they sound.</p>
<p>But one guy snuck through the gates &#8211; <em>&#8220;Hey man, I work for a big company but don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m cool &#8211; I just have some ideas for a TV show about Mustachian lifestyles and wondered if you want to talk about them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>So we talked on the phone, and he was indeed cool. It was a nice concept and a respectable company and they had done other successful stuff. So I said I might help out with the project occasionally, as time permitted.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a completely unrelated person from their legal department started emailing me contracts and agreements and such &#8211; pages of them! The contracts contained obligations, promises, and bullshit galore.</p>
<p>And here I was just naively thinking I&#8217;d have a beer with this creative writer and laugh about some ideas for a TV show. We had already agreed on the phone, that if the project ever ceased to be completely fun &#8211; for either of us &#8211; then we&#8217;d just drop it. Retirement is is too short to engage in non-fun projects, because there is already an enormous queue of <em>extremely</em> fun projects that I haven&#8217;t even had time to start yet!</p>
<p>So I told the lawyers thanks, but I wasn&#8217;t interested in contracts. But I&#8217;d still be happy to help out just as I had originally offered.</p>
<p>And I never heard from anyone at the company, or the creative guy, ever again.</p>
<p>I felt like I had been stood up &#8211; the whole thing had been a small waste of time. But I was grateful that I hadn&#8217;t actually dug in on a big project with an organization that works this way &#8211; for that would have been a much bigger waste of time.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s contrast this with a a few other business arrangements.</p>
<div id="attachment_14007" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/camp-mustache.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-14007"><img class="size-full wp-image-14007" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/camp-mustache.jpg" alt="Figure 1 - Camp Mustache" width="600" height="394" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/camp-mustache.jpg 600w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/camp-mustache-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/camp-mustache-300x197.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/camp-mustache-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1 &#8211; Camp Mustache</p></div>
<p>I have fixed up plenty of houses with local friends, with many thousands of dollars at stake. Sometimes even lives or limbs, as we scrambled around like monkeys to cut down tall dead trees.  No contracts, just plenty of dirt, scrapes, laughs and good times &#8211; and profits, too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done several interviews and trips with <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/07/28/jesse-ynab-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Mecham</a>, founder of <strong><a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You Need a Budget</a></strong>. Significant value accrued to both of our businesses from these collaborations as thousands of YNAB customers became Mustachians and vice versa, and yet somehow it never occurred to us to make up a contract.</p>
<p>Next month I&#8217;m traveling to Portland &#8211; first to visit <strong><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treehouse</a></strong> founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ryancarson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Carson</a> and do some social stuff that might also have promotional value for his business. Maybe record a video and a podcast, and even host a <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/meetups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gathering of Mustachians</a> right in the courtyard of their central Portland building. With beer!</p>
<p>No contracts, of course.</p>
<p>Then on to Seattle to attend Camp Mustache &#8211; something that is now a popular recurring event. Although there are tens of thousands of dollars involved in putting it on, it&#8217;s an informal not-for-profit arrangement and the organizers and I have never signed a contract.</p>
<p><strong>But What if the Other Person Breaks their Promise and I Get Screwed?</strong></p>
<p>You may think I&#8217;m painting an unrealistically rosy picture here. Not everything always turns out for the better, right? Business partners sometimes turn evil, tenants stop paying rent, girlfriends or boyfriends dump you, products break,  stock markets crash, bones break, and fatal diseases strike your loved ones.</p>
<p>I agree &#8211; life has been known to serve up the odd Platter of Shit from time to time. Every one of those things above has happened to me. And yet in zero of the cases could I have protected myself with a contract or warranty and come out ahead.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to court a few times. In some cases, I was the landlord and the tenant wasn&#8217;t paying rent even though we had a contract. The judge ordered the tenant to pay. The tenant, who had long since left town, didn&#8217;t even know there had been a court case. And yet life went on, and the inconvenience was soon forgotten.</p>
<p>I retired early, invested too much in a house building business, then lost a bunch of money in the ensuing great financial and housing crisis. No contract could have protected me from these market realities, and yet somehow I survived again and life continued to get even better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had products malfunction while under warranty, and in most cases the warranty department was so clumsy and incompetent (ahem, Samsung, Nissan) that I just gave up and fixed the product myself.</p>
<p>The point is that in almost all life decisions, the stakes are actually very low. Here in the rich world, the majority of our catastrophes have the following consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might feel &#8220;inconvenienced&#8221; and experience a frowning face for a short period of time.</li>
<li>Some numbers stored in a computer, which represent your wealth, might temporarily decrease.</li>
<li>You might have to move your body around &#8211; and possibly even experience mild heat, cold, or muscular exertion.</li>
<li>You might have to speak some words into a telephone or press some buttons on a computer keyboard to resolve a problem.</li>
<li>In more extreme situations, you might even have to speak to one or more humans in person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these consequences really worth worrying about &#8211; or potentially even missing out on the chance to do something great?</p>
<p><strong>What does This Have to do with Early Retirement?</strong></p>
<p>Every week, I get at least a few emails from people who have <em>more</em> than put in their time. People in their late 30s and beyond who have worked multi-decade careers, paid off the house, given their kids a good start in life, stashed seven figures into retirement accounts, and long since grown bored of the big-company life.</p>
<p>But they are still working <strong>one more year</strong>, to add that last bit of safety margin padding, fill up that last college fund for the last kid, max out that health savings account just in case. Some of them have more savings than my family has even now, even though we&#8217;ve been retired (and continuing to accumulate wealth) for more than ten years.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re still afraid to retire.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You Become Free </strong><strong>Only when you Acknowledge That You Cannot Control Life</strong></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t control the random bits of misfortune which may strike you. You can only control your responses.</p>
<p>If you are following the Principles of Mustachianism, you&#8217;ve already taken all the preventative work that you need to take: optimizing your <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/03/19/a-lifetime-of-riches-is-it-as-simple-as-a-few-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">habits</span></a> to maintain a healthy body, mind, and bank account.</p>
<p>These are not a formal insurance policy, because formal insurance is nonsense.</p>
<p>They are a statistical prevention policy, a way of tilting the odds in our favor. And even more important, a response policy &#8211; a recipe that ensures that even when shit <em>does</em> hit the fan, you can clean it up, resume your prosperous life, and learn something in the process.</p>
<p>The lesson? Instead of working endlessly to build a glass shield around yourself, start enjoying life right now and just keep a mop handy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em><strong>Further Reading:</strong> In his joyful short book &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2oC7ong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anything you Want</a></span>&#8221; on founding a really successful business, Derek Sivers argues the same thing about contracts &#8211; just skip them if you can possibly do so, because people will either keep their word, or they won&#8217;t. If you bring it to court, everybody loses, and all a contract does is give you something to show in court.</em></p>

Much more has changed since then!</p></div>
<p>In early April of 2011, I started a blog. Although I secretly hoped that lots of people would end up reading it, it was partly just a form of personal therapy &#8211; a place where I fight back against a world that had obviously lost its mind, by sharing some financial and living advice that should have already been obvious.</p>
<p>This weird hobby ended up being a pretty good idea, as it has blown up my life in many ways and made it even more satisfying. Early retirement is already a great thing, but enjoying a long, youthful retirement where you get to feel like you&#8217;re actually helping other people is far better.  This website has served about 25 million unique visitors, and even the regulars are now in the seven digits. On top of that, I&#8217;ve had the honor (and sometimes embarrassment) of showing up in several bigger bits of media (some of them listed on this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/road-trips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media page</a></span></strong>).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s tough to have such a big opportunity and still maintain a mostly-retired life. When you do the math, even a small bit of extra research and work on my part to make these articles more accurate and less haphazard, would provide much more benefit to these people than any inconvenience it would cause me.</p>
<p><em><strong>Side note:</strong> The most powerful media boosts were not those stories in The New Yorker, TV News shows, or the Wall Street Journal like you&#8217;d expect, but rather an unscripted and rambling conversation on the <strong><a href="http://tim.blog/2017/02/13/mr-money-mustache/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tim Ferriss Podcast</span></a></strong> &#8211; a sign of how much the world is changing beneath the feet of the old establishment.</em></p>
<p>Logically, this means that I really should be working on MMM project full-time, and have a big team of dedicated helpers. An even bigger site could create plenty of money to allow this and the work is very rewarding. That extra money could <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/26/notes-on-giving-away-100000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefit</a> a whole lot of people.</p>
<p>But I really don&#8217;t like sitting down and typing indoors all day. So instead I constantly choose to slack off by indulging in low-wage DIY construction work and spending time with family and friends. In the time since my last blog article, we bought an old building downtown and embarked upon a major renovation of it. But this construction project has in turn been interrupted by several visiting guests, a four-day snowboarding trip, and a flurry of local meetings. This week, my son and I spent about 4 hours developing some homemade rifle scopes for Nerf guns. There&#8217;s just so much to do in life besides the most &#8220;important&#8221; work.</p>
<p>The self-imposed pressure to always do more is a nag, but it would be ridiculous for me to ever complain about a life like this. So instead, I will just say &#8220;Thanks&#8221; for this first amazing six years, and here&#8217;s to our next <strong>sixty</strong> years of changing the world together.</p>
<p>And by &#8220;together&#8221; I mean, &#8220;You doing all the hard work of shifting to a a more badass, efficient, wealthy lifestyle while also converting your friends, while I hang out here in Longmont and occasionally type some shit into the computer to egg you on.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Useful Stuff and News:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1: How to Find Stuff on Mr. Money Mustache or Anywhere else:</strong></p>
<p>Many people send me emails asking for advice, not knowing I&#8217;ve already written about the subject in the past. To find past articles, try typing stuff like the following into your web browser:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=site:mrmoneymustache.com+401k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site:mrmoneymustache.com 401k</a></strong><br />
<strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=site:mrmoneymustache.com+car+clowns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site:mrmoneymustache.com car clowns</a></strong></p>
<p>and so on. You can do this with <em>any</em> web site and find useful information in their old stuff very easily. For example, let&#8217;s search the entire &#8220;<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum</a>&#8221; section of this blog (since it has about 1.4 million different posts from over 32,000 registered members) for conversations about scholarships:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aforum.mrmoneymustache.com+scholarships&amp;oq=site%3Aforum.mrmoneymustache.com+scholarships&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.295j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site:forum.mrmoneymustache.com scholarships</a></strong></p>
<p>Or search every city in the entire US and beyond (via Craigslist) for used Nissan Leafs:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=site:craigslist.org+nissan+leaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site:craigslist.org nissan leaf</a></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Tangential Pro Tip:</strong> you can buy a car from someone you trust in another state, negotiate the deal however you like, then then get it shipped directly to you via companies like Uship &#8211; typically for under $1000.  A great trick for casting a wider net!</em></p>
<p><strong>2: Stuff I&#8217;ve been doing besides Writing Blog Posts:</strong></p>
<p>Writing the Foreword to the upcoming &#8220;Your Money or Your Life&#8221;</p>
<p>Through good fortune and the Magic of the Internet, Vicki Robin, the author of the original book that brought Financial Independence into the consciousness of the modern world, has decided to write a new edition of the book and ended up joining forces with today&#8217;s happy circle of FI writers. She invited me to write the foreword to the new edition, which is obviously an amazing honor. I&#8217;ll let you know when the new version of Your Money Or Your Life comes out &#8211; it will surely become the new standard by which all other books on personal finance are judged. You can listen to Vicki&#8217;s moving story of a lifetime of activism in her interview on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.madfientist.com/vicki-robin-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this podcast from our mutual friend The Mad Fientist</a></span>.</p>
<p><em>Reading</em> the Foreword to &#8220;The Simple Path to Wealth&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet another friend and all-around-good-guy <a href="http://jlcollinsnh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Collins</a> wrote <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2pq7YUh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a great book on how simple stock investing is</a></span>, and it turned out to be a stunning success. So successful that Jim told me he has been forced to massively increase his charitable giving program, which made me very happy. And so successful that the publishing industry came back to him to do an audio book version of The Simple Path, for use on Amazon&#8217;s Audible.com library.</p>
<p>Now, this book also happens to include a foreword from old Mr. Money Mustache. Since Jim is doing his own narration, they asked me to narrate my own foreword. I gladly agreed, and this has become yet another small but important task piled upon my Jenga tower of a life.</p>
<p>Pop-Up Business School Comes to America</p>
<p>On the last group Ecuador trip, I met a high-energy entrepreneurial British fellow named <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Qo23u9UOA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan Donegan</a></span> who runs a school that trains people to start their own businesses &#8211; with very little money. He gave an impromptu session to the 25 or so of us on that trip, and we were all impressed and entertained.</p>
<p>So far, it has helped thousands of people in England, and he was thinking of trying it on this side of the pond. If we can get our act together quickly enough, we&#8217;ll host him here in Longmont this summer, and maybe in other cities as well. If you want to add your town to the list of stops, or support our effort here in Stashtown, you can find Alan through his <a href="http://www.popupbusinessschool.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop-up Business School</a> website.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for the Birthday Edition. I&#8217;ll be back with new, better-than-ever articles just as soon as it&#8217;s time to take the next break from real life. I hope your Spring is going just as well.</p>

<p>The secret is that my wife is no longer really retired, and in fact she started a business that is now big enough to fund our entire family&#8217;s lifestyle. Making this confession will subject both of us to the full fury of the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/13/mr-money-mustache-vs-the-internet-retirement-police/" target="_blank">Internet Retirement Police</a>. But it&#8217;s worth it, because there are some valuable lessons in her experience that could be useful to other people hoping to take control of their own income.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always fascinated and happy to see people making money through <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/08/the-joy-of-self-employment/" target="_blank">self-employment</a>, (especially in fields that don&#8217;t require a university degree) because it presents a nice shortcut around most of the problems that the world of work presents to us. Prefer to set your own schedule? Go right ahead. Unhappy with work conditions? Change them. Want a raise? Company profits are under <em>your</em> control. Don&#8217;t like your boss? Just find a mirror and have a quick word with yourself.  Sure, there are loads of great jobs out there, but conventional employment is often only a small, boring slice of a life&#8217;s work experience.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve almost certainly heard of  Etsy, a highly popular online marketplace that specializes in handmade, small batch products &#8211; most often produced by a single person. Almost everything there is cute, unique, and custom, which makes it a hit in the gift-giving and personal pampering markets. And because the focus is on small entrepreneurial business and relatively natural products, even Mr. Money Mustache can get behind the general theme without <em>too</em> much grumbling about clueless consumers.</p>
<p>My wife was a fan and an occasional customer, but also became curious about just how difficult it would be to make some of the things that were for sale &#8211; often at relatively high prices. So she launched an investigation, which has led to two years of fun and learning, and is still growing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>When I first posted this article, we asked people to please avoid trying to track down her Etsy shop, just to keep her experiment realistic. A small percentage of good-hearted but mischievous Mustachians disregarded this request and flooded her shop with orders anyway. Almost her entire current soap inventory (over $1000 worth) was quickly sold out. So if you do find her shop, you&#8217;ll only see a few remaining products for now. You&#8217;ll have to use your imagination to picture what it usually looks like &#8211; an array of 20 different fancy looking soaps and other products.</em></p>
<p>So to continue this tale, let&#8217;s launch into an interview with the lady herself.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">An Interview With an Etsy Entrepreneur</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Money Mustache:</strong> Hello there wife! Thanks so much for allowing me to do this interview with you &#8211; I know you&#8217;re normally not a fan of the public eye.</p>
<p>So to start things off, what is it exactly that tempted you to get into the business of being an Etsy seller in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Money Mustache: </strong>Hello husband! It is strange and fun to be <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/tag/mrs-money-mustache/" target="_blank">back on the blog</a>, so thanks for doing this article.</p>
<p>Becoming an Etsy Seller was a gradual process, as it is with many folks, I suspect. I was sitting around being all retired and, frankly, I was bored sometimes. At the time, I didn&#8217;t have a real plan for all my free time.</p>
<p>One day, while standing with a group of parents at the after-school pickup, I became enamored with these lovely wrap bracelets with pretty beads all the moms seemed to be wearing. I hadn&#8217;t seen them before and became curious, so I started shopping online. I found out they cost a small fortune and, not really being a jewelry person, I quickly dismissed the purchase.</p>
<p>But, upon further review, I saw they were selling on Etsy and this prompted me to think I could make one myself. So, I dove down into a rabbit hole of watching videos and buying supplies and I was hooked. Learning and making really filled a void in my life, so I went a little crazy. I made a bunch of bracelets, gave them to friends, and at a certain point, I had spent more than I felt comfortable on the whole endeavor.</p>
<p>This is when I came back to Etsy and the idea of selling was born. I figured if I could <em>sell</em> enough of these bracelets I had learned to make, I could pay myself back for all the stuff I had bought to make them recreationally.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> Wow, that&#8217;s interesting &#8211; selling as an atonement for consumer guilt? It sounds negative when you put it that way, but it seems to have become a big positive in your life. So anyway, what date was this?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>This was in April of 2014. That&#8217;s when I started my first shop.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> How long did it take to get your first sale? And how have your sales ramped up since then? What was your busiest month so far?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM:  </strong>It definitely took a while to get my first sale. About 2.5 months after first opening my shop. But, I was so busy making items and learning about Etsy that I didn&#8217;t really notice the time pass. I remember it was a holiday-specific item (a fourth of July bracelet) and that&#8217;s when I realized the importance of holidays in retail (duh!)</p>
<p>My sales increased really slowly over time. I did so much research by lurking around in the Etsy forums and finding out what makes other shops successful. I created a lot of different products (necklaces, bracelets, guitar picks, even crocheted dish cloths!) so I could test them out and see which were successful. A wise man once said: &#8220;<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/10/how-to-be-happy-rich-and-save-the-world/" target="_blank">Work is better when you don&#8217;t need the money.</a>&#8221; and he was right. :) I was able to do a lot more than a shop that can&#8217;t invest much due to money constraints.</p>
<p>My busiest time, by far, was the holiday season of 2015. In November and December of 2015 I was so busy that I couldn&#8217;t keep up and had to place my shop on vacation mode (Etsy has an option for that, which basically means: I&#8217;m not open for business at the moment.) During just those two months I sold about $10,000 of stuff. I was working constantly and it got in the way of family time and I realized I needed more balance.</p>

<p><strong>MMM:</strong> I noticed that even after your first shop became fairly successful, you actually started a second Etsy shop. What was the cause of this? How has the experience been, compared to the first?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>Yes! I decided to start a second Etsy shop in August 2016. As an Etsy Seller, I really wanted to support other Etsy sellers, so I started buying stuff from them quite a bit. I purchased almost all my shop supplies on Etsy and I also started buying small gifts.</p>
<p>One year, I bought some handmade soaps for family members at Christmas and tried one out myself. I fell in love with it and realized how much better my skin felt. Of course, as a crazy-researcher-type (which is what I realize I am, post retirement), I decided to try making my own soap. This led to a second love and once I felt confident in my products, I opened my second shop, which sells mostly natural bath and body products (soaps, scrubs, lotions, and oils).</p>
<p>This second shop is so much more fun than the first. For one thing, I am making products that I love using myself and really believe in. I also had so much experience at making my first shop successful that the second one was much easier. I had a few customers that shopped at my first shop that immediately bought from my second shop. So, that first sale came much faster.</p>
<p>I also really love the &#8220;soaping community&#8221;. All the soapers I&#8217;ve met through Instagram (which is a platform I used to hate and now love) are so generous with time and information and they make beautiful products too. It&#8217;s just a completely different (and more fulfilling) experience this time around.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> How do you decide what to make and what to sell &#8211; and which products to discontinue?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>In both shops, I try a lot of different things. I follow my own feelings of what I&#8217;d like to wear or use. I like to make new items and sometimes they do really well and sometimes they don&#8217;t. I also find that in the bath &amp; body world, you get repeat customers much more easily. So, they will let me know what they want more of, which has led me to keep products that I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should continue and making new ones.</p>
<p>I also follow my values. For example, right now many of my bath and body products are all natural, but I&#8217;ve also tried using ingredients that aren&#8217;t considered natural. I like to experiment and decide for myself what I like. But, after dabbling in fragrance oils and other &#8220;not 100% natural&#8221; ingredients, I find myself veering back towards all-natural. I&#8217;m trying out a lot of different packaging and am finding that this is a challenge as well, as I want everything to be eco-friendly, but also reasonably priced.</p>
<p>So, I guess I discontinue items that aren&#8217;t doing well and that I&#8217;m not a huge fan of either. But, I will always make new things (because that&#8217;s the fun part), so I will always want to sell new items along with the ones that stay on and sell well.</p>
<p><strong>MMM: </strong>What are the factors in your success &#8211; Is this something just anybody can do? If not, what skills or personal tendencies do you think would create a good Etsy shop owner?</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>My success (or, my definition of success anyway) is probably due to incessant research. I am always researching. I read a lot and look at a lot of other shops and try to figure stuff out. It&#8217;s a fun puzzle and I think it is the most interesting part of owning an Etsy shop for me. I would get bored if I wasn&#8217;t doing that. The business half of my degree is finally coming in handy!</p>
<p>To be successful on Etsy, you need to understand how SEO (search engine optimization) works. Etsy has their own search engine, so you just need to figure out how to make your listings show up near the top, which is easier said than done!</p>
<p>Once you know that, you need beautiful pictures so that people actually click on your listing. Again, this takes a lot of research and some photography skills. I look at every single picture in a search result and figure out what makes me click on an image. I also look at my listing in that list and see if it stands out.</p>
<p>For example: I recently realized that I was clicking more on photos of soap with packaging than &#8220;naked soap&#8221;, so I changed one of my listings so that the first photo had packaging &#8211; and it did result in more sales.</p>
<div id="attachment_13884" style="width: 545px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-13884" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-1024x768.jpg" alt="Doing what it takes to get the shot." width="535" height="402" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-900x675.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography-320x240.jpg 320w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floor-photography.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Doing what it takes to get the shot.</p></div>
<p>SEO and quality photos are the two biggest things. After that, you need to give excellent customer service and ship your packages out in time. It helps if your packages look cute upon arrival too. That leads to good reviews and word of mouth, which leads to more sales.</p>
<p><strong>MMM: </strong>What has been the biggest unexpected positive, and negative, in your experience in dealing with customers?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>The biggest positive has come from my second shop, as I have built up repeat customers in a relatively short amount of time. These are people that leave me incredible reviews, send me a message that brightens my day, post their purchases on Instagram, etc. I am very surprised by this, but it does bring me a lot of joy.</p>
<p>The negatives used to affect me a lot, but I&#8217;ve learned that they will always be there. There are people that leave one star reviews without contacting me first. People can be pretty brutal when reviewing a product. I don&#8217;t think they realize they are leaving a review to a single person (as opposed to a company). It&#8217;s one thing to say &#8220;Amazon sucks&#8221;, but when someone says &#8220;You suck&#8221;, that&#8217;s totally different. Sometimes they are folks that own a competing shop on Etsy (or have a friend that does), so you know the review isn&#8217;t even accurate or relevant, but it still sits there staring you in the face.</p>
<p><strong>MMM: </strong>I hear you on that Mean Internet Strangers thing. Sometimes I stumble across multi-page discussions on Reddit or Bogleheads, among people I&#8217;ve never met, who are just making the most bizarre and pessimistic speculations about our personal lives, or my motivation for writing the blog, or whatever. There is no practical way to set everyone straight, so you really just have to develop a thicker skin instead.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>I think it&#8217;s a bit easier in the smaller world of an Etsy shop. There are also a lot of difficult customers, but I always answer all their questions and do my best and some of them have actually made large purchases or become repeat customers. One of my best customers in my second shop was someone that was previously difficult.</p>
<p><strong>MMM: </strong>What do you think the upper limit on profit would be in an etsy shop? Do any of your role models or competitors seem to be running pretty big operations?</p>
<div id="attachment_13882" style="width: 546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-13882" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating-1024x684.jpg" alt="Doing the Math" width="536" height="358" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating-1024x684.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating-900x601.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calculating.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Doing the Math</p></div>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>The sky is the limit! There are many shops on Etsy that started off as one-person endeavors and now they own huge businesses with many employees. Most of them move on from Etsy and start their own web sites, which makes sense as they no longer need the Etsy platform to generate sales.</p>
<p>Etsy also has rules about manufacturing help and the handmade nature of items, so if you get big and want to start selling different things, it makes sense to move on.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the goal for me, although I might use a helper during the holidays sometimes. (MMM himself has been known to sit on the couch and cut out hundreds of cardboard squares for my packaging material)</p>
<p>My goal is to keep making and to keep learning&#8230; not to have a huge money-making operation. My word for 2017 is &#8216;balance&#8217;. :)</p>
<p>I should also add that on the lower end, it&#8217;s very easy to make <em>nothing</em>, or even lose money on an Etsy shop. There&#8217;s a lot of competition, so it is not easy to get established. Hard work and endless patience are essential to get through that painful first year.</p>
<p><strong>MMM:</strong> Hmm, there were no numbers in your answer, but I guess we don&#8217;t really know how any of those huge Etsy sellers personally. But based on their photographs of daily production I&#8217;d estimate that the upper limit <em>might</em> be in the $200,000 range of annual profit for a single-person shop. $1000 per day in sales, minus about 33% in cost of materials and other overhead.</p>
<p>But as you say, shops can get much bigger than that &#8211; they just usually leave Etsy, hire some employees, and expand into a standalone operation.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s talk about your situation instead &#8211; what&#8217;s the net hourly profit you would say you make at this stage, now that you are established?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM:  </strong>Hmmm&#8230; that&#8217;s tricky because I keep wanting to make new things, so I am spending more than I would be if I were purely profit-driven. My first shop is at a stage where my profits are very good compared to my revenue because I&#8217;ve lost a bit of interest in that shop and am not spending much on it. Hourly, I&#8217;m guessing around $30 per hour. However, as a result of me losing interest, it has slowed down quite a bit and it is actually &#8220;on vacation&#8221; on Etsy at the moment.</p>
<p>My second shop is still in the growing stages, so profits are not that great at the moment. I&#8217;m also finally at a place where my prices are set where I want them to be. My up front investment was quite big and soap takes 4-6 weeks to cure, so that shop is still up in the air, profit-wise. But, I&#8217;m guessing it will become more profitable on an hourly basis than my first shop once I ramp up my operations by making larger batches (less time spent and supplies cost less when bought in bulk).</p>
<p>So yeah, good question. I guess my answer is: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. I should probably calculate that.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_13885" style="width: 568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-13885"><img class="wp-image-13885" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-1024x1024.jpg" alt="wet_soap" width="558" height="558" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-180x180.jpg 180w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-768x768.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-144x144.jpg 144w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-900x900.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap-65x65.jpg 65w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wet_soap.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A freshly poured batch of soap. This hardens overnight, and you cut it into 16 bars. 4 weeks later, it is cured and ready to sell.</p></div>
<p>For example, to make a 5 pound batch of soap (a &#8220;loaf&#8221;) takes about $20 worth of materials if you are using high-end stuff like coconut and olive oils. This takes roughly 2 hours of labor by the time you make it, clean up, and later cut and package the soap. You end up with 16 bars, which sell on Etsy for $6 each. So, your profit is about $80, for roughly two hours of work. But that work is spread over a month, so you need make a bunch of batches to keep things in stock.</p>
<p><strong>MMM: </strong>Where do you see this hobby taking you?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM:  </strong>Ultimately, I want to be able to use this hobby for community building. I imagine owning a store somewhere on Main Street that sells my products, but also empowers others to make. I see myself teaching others how to make their own things and how to start their own shops. I see myself making alongside others and having this ongoing conversation about our common problems and our successes. I imagine connecting with other makers in a community space. I see us all teaching kids that you can make instead of buy, create instead of consume. You can own your own business while also doing the things you enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>MMM </strong>(update): During the casual yearlong process of working on this article, we ended up stumbling upon an interesting, underpriced old building on Main Street, and are now about to purchase it. It will make for some interesting stories (and parties too), so I&#8217;ll keep you posted on that.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>The maker&#8217;s movement is huge and is having a big resurgence in our modern lives. I am the type of person that never considered myself &#8220;creative&#8221;. I still wouldn&#8217;t use that word to describe myself, but I am now a handmade maker. I make stuff with my hands and they are sometimes even useful things! You can do it too!</p>
<p>I would love to go back in time (or forward in time) and live in a world where everyone is a maker of things and we just make and trade with each other. The simplicity and the community of that framework really appeals to me and it gets at the root of what makes us human.</p>
<p><strong>MMM: </strong>During these past two years, I have mentioned your growing Etsy hobby, but never told anyone how to find your shop. And even with this article, I still want to encourage readers <strong><em>not</em> to go out and try to find her shop on Etsy</strong>. We both felt that doing so would be a form of &#8220;cheating&#8221;.  Can you explain this philosophy?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. MM: </strong>It was really important for me to create my own success, independently. Success isn&#8217;t as fulfilling if you cheat! I&#8217;m pretty sure that almost every single person who purchased from me didn&#8217;t know my secret identity and that feels good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve built all of this myself, from scratch. I&#8217;ve also learned that many people will pay big bucks to cheat the system (whether it is online selling, blogging, etc). I&#8217;ve found that the harder, longer road, is always better in the end.</p>
<p><strong>MMM: </strong>That&#8217;s really cool. And it&#8217;s also more educational for you. As a relatively high achiever with skills in software and technology, and no financial pressure, it can be argued that you are already &#8220;cheating&#8221; compared to most Etsy sellers.</p>
<p>But if you do it right, financial independence is the <em>good </em>kind of cheating &#8211; you preserve the learning and effort, but cut off the stress and any temptation to create shortcuts.</p>
<p>And even without financial independence, entrepreneurship is a huge advantage to add to your collection of life experiences. I have a bunch more stories of entrepreneurial friends I&#8217;ve been wanting to share with you, so let&#8217;s do it in the months to come.</p>

<p>Envisioning this potential (and sometimes even having the opportunity to design some of it) is one of the greatest joys of being alive. But slamming up against the stubborn wall of society&#8217;s inertia, all day, every day, can lead to some displays of choice language.</p>
<p>If only we could grasp onto even a tiny fraction of the improvements that are hanging right in front of our faces, our society could bypass decades or centuries of pain, and billions of people could lead happier lives, starting this afternoon.</p>
<p>We can illustrate this problem perfectly with an example from right here in my home town. Take a look at this Google Maps satellite image of where Colorado Highway 287, (also known as Main Street) crosses over the St. Vrain Creek:</p>
<div id="attachment_13807" style="width: 530px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-13807"><img class="wp-image-13807" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge.jpg" alt="main-bridge" width="520" height="415" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge.jpg 922w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge-300x239.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge-768x612.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/main-bridge-900x717.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Colorado Highway 287 makes a lame leap across the creek.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty boring, right? And that is exactly my point. It&#8217;s a boring, utilitarian bridge, in a blighted, shitty area of town dominated by parking lots, used car dealerships, traffic, and noise. When you drive along that part of 287, you don&#8217;t even notice you are crossing a bridge. It&#8217;s just part of the wide, flat road. And besides, you&#8217;re busy navigating the ugly, stressful terrain of dense traffic &#8211; passing through in a rush to get to somewhere nicer.</p>
<p>Now, I happen to bike right <em>under</em> this bridge quite often, because Longmont&#8217;s excellent St. Vrain Greenway path allows you whiz along through the whole town, bypassing all the trouble that the car drivers have to deal with above. Down on the bike path it&#8217;s just you, recharging your soul and your muscles, passing a few other cyclists and watching the crystal clear water as it flows over oval multicolored granite rocks, maybe a few ducks and geese building nests along the water&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>In 2013, that Main Street bridge was partially destroyed, along with quite a few other things in town, by an enormous flood. So they decided to rebuild it. And I decided to follow along with the project, because hey, I&#8217;m an engineer.</p>
<p>What I learned is that building even the smallest, least noteworthy road bridge is a spectacular project. The engineering calculations alone cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The machinery involved would fill a football field, and the quantity of soil, steel, and concrete you need to move around is difficult to even comprehend. They have been working on this one insignificant bridge for over three years now, and I&#8217;m still waiting for the bike path to re-open.</p>

<p>The total cost was estimated at <strong>5.6 million dollars</strong>, which puts it roughly on par with, say, this 10-bathroom waterfront megamansion compound currently for sale in Florida:</p>

<p>And if you want a bigger bridge, like the flyovers with cloverleafs that get built every time two highways happen to interconnect, you can spend 100 times more.</p>

<p>Do you see the problem here?</p>
<p>This is exactly the same stuff I talk about in personal finance, except applied on a bigger scale.</p>
<p>The average American gets the most expensive car he can afford, and drives it as much as he can &#8211; for virtually 100% of trips out of the house. And yet he has a net worth of nearly zero, and subpar physical health, for most of his life.</p>
<p>The average American <em>city</em> builds the largest roads and parking lots it can possibly fund, maximizing the amount of available space for vehicles, in a noble attempt to reduce traffic and serve its citizens. But the result is that cities become nothing but wide, well-engineered, fast, deadly expanses of concrete. These are terrifying places for walkers and cyclists, which builds still more demand for more cars and more roads.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear here: I&#8217;m a capitalist, lifelong student of economics, pro-growth techno-utopian, and basically the opposite of a luddite. Efficient transportation is a huge wealth-builder for society, so we will always need bridges and fast roads. But these valuable resources will always be very expensive, so it makes sense not to waste them.</p>
<p>A transport truck full of factory components or food brings great wealth to Longmont when it crosses that bridge over the creek. The problem is the 400 single-occupant personal cars and trucks cramming up the rest of that road, full of people who are only driving because they don&#8217;t realize there is a better way.</p>
<p>Since even the most mundane bridge costs as much as a Mega Mansion, we are effectively building millions of mega-mansions mostly to to facilitate our clunky personal transport machines that are about 95% inefficient. And the whole reason we &#8220;need&#8221; cars in the first place is because we spread everything out by making our roads so big! It&#8217;s a circular problem.</p>
<p>Collectively, we spend almost half of our tax dollars on paving over our living spaces, or dealing with the consequences of the lifestyle created by that pavement.</p>
<p>The solution in both cases is so obvious, and yet almost nobody ever talks about it. In fact, many of us are still working to perpetuate and accelerate this stupidity.</p>
<p>Right now, as you read this, millions of people are passionately shopping around for new, better cars, and hundreds of American cities are planning enormous expansions of their road systems &#8211; new bridges, wider lanes, bigger parking structures. Politicians whine about our &#8220;crumbling infrastructure&#8221; and vow to rebuild it with emergency packages of deficit spending. Because we obviously need to build even more of it, even faster.</p>
<p><strong>To Want Something Better, You Must Understand  the Core of Our Problem</strong></p>

<p>When you&#8217;re born into a system, you come to think of it as normal. This was even true for me, growing up in an industrialized area and lusting after nice cars and motorcycles as I passed through my teens, feeling the frustration of heavy traffic jams and the joy of the open road.</p>
<p>But the quest for optimization led me naturally to bicycle transportation and minimizing car commutes, which led me to the study of urban planning, and the forehead-slapping realization that we&#8217;re doing everything wrong.</p>
<p>What it didn&#8217;t tell me, is how we got to this bizarre place. I mean, here are all of these relatively smart, wealthy people in this incredibly rich country, but our behavior is demonstrably self-defeating. What led us to this point, and how do we fix it?</p>
<p>Recently, I had the joy of reading a book about exactly this subject, from an author who has put much more thought and work into fixing it than I have. To put it moderately, it blew my mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2kIUAJH" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Happy City</span></a>, by Charles Montgomery, pretends to be a book about how cities are laid out, but you very quickly realize that it&#8217;s much more &#8211; a brilliant and thoughtful book about Everything that Matters &#8211; human happiness in the past, present, and future, and just how incredibly powerful our immediate environment is, in dictating this most important thing.</p>
<p>As you read through the book, which I have now done <em>twice </em>over the past six months (something I never do), you realize that city design strongly influences everything about our lives &#8211; our health, wealth, social networks, longevity, satisfaction and our tendency towards trust or violence which in turn even dictates how we will vote*.</p>
<p>And yet, for over 50 years we have been designing our cities in almost the most stupid, expensive, ineffective way possible. For example, did you realize that the following stuff is studied and well-documented around the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building in the modern North American way (wide roads, big parking lots, wide lawns and plenty of space for every car) is the most expensive way that any group of humans have ever lived. We consume more concrete, water, pipes, wire, sidewalks, sign posts, landscaping, and fuel for this privilege.</li>
<li>But we don&#8217;t get any value for these dollars: we spend more time and money getting around than ever before, which leaves us with a chronic shortage of time to enjoy any potential benefits of dispersed living.</li>
<li>People who live in suburbs are much less trusting of other people than people who live in walkable neighborhoods where housing is mixed with shops, services, and places to work. This is because they have far fewer relationships with people who live nearby. And yet the overwhelming message of happiness research is that<strong> relationships with other people have the biggest influence on our happiness.</strong></li>
<li>if 10 percent more people thought they had someone to count on in life, it would have a greater effect on national life satisfaction than giving everyone a 50 percent raise.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we are getting a poor value for our money.</p>
<p>But how can it be a poor value if this is what people chose for themselves? It&#8217;s the free market at work, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>

One of my life goals is that we &#8211; quite literally you and me &#8211; build a city like this here in the USA.</p></div>
<p>The book goes on to explain the history of suburbia, which I had never quite learned before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Originally, we had big dense cities, small towns, and agricultural areas. The small towns were where people tended to be happiest.</li>
<li>Cities expanded to meet the desires of the workers: being close to work, but also having clean air and privacy like their small town counterparts. Housing was built at the edges in &#8220;street car neighborhoods&#8221; If you have ever walked around residential San Francisco, this is the basic feel.</li>
<li>When cars joined the picture, a consortium of GM, Firestone, Phillips Oil, Shell Oil, and Standard Oil bought up street car companies and shut them down. They also lobbied the government heavily and formed &#8220;Motorist Associations&#8221; to advocate for the rights of drivers &#8211; making driving more convenient and thus boosting driving demand for their products.</li>
<li>Cars were originally thought of as dangerous intruders in the city. If a driver killed a pedestrian with his car, it was a crime.<br />
The motorist associations pushed to change this balance: they sought to convince people that the problem of safety involved making sure <em>people</em> did not get in the way of cars.<br />
They invented the crime of &#8220;Jaywalking&#8221;, which is crossing a street somewhere other than a controlled crossing area.<br />
They pushed in the current legal arrangement, where if you kill a person with your car, it&#8217;s probably just a traffic violation. In some cases, it won&#8217;t be your fault at all as long as you were obeying the rules of the road.</li>
<li>Motorist associations also continually push for car-friendly policies like highway expansion, fighting against traffic tickets and speed traps, and even write articles like &#8220;<a href="https://www.motorists.org/blog/elons-carbon-con/" target="_blank">Elon&#8217;s Carbon Con</a>&#8220;, completely misunderstanding (or deliberately misrepresenting?) the entire life purpose of one of my favorite humans.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bullet point strays into politics, because you get into a battle of freedom versus regulation. I personally feel that if in doubt, you should err on the side of freedom. And in this regard, the book brought up its most stunning point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our current city planning method is <em>not</em> the result of free market forces at all. It&#8217;s actually an incredibly strict book of regulations which separates functions &#8211; residential, commercial, and industrial. It also defines setbacks, lot sizes, intersections, and parking requirements. It is all standardized in a group of standard, downloadable regulations that most cities purchase from Municode, while the road design comes from the Federal Highway Association&#8217;s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUCTD).</li>
<li>This is a self-replicating zombie of a system: every new town simply downloads and implements the existing book of rules without thinking about it, because &#8220;This is how things work in America&#8221;</li>
<li>But that original book of rules was built from an almost comical chain of events. The oil companies and motorist associations. Special interests and racism, like a regulation in Modesto, CA which banned clothes washing facilites from the main street, which happened to be run by Chinese people. The desire of rich people to keep away poor people (which is easy to do legally if you just ban duplexes and apartment buildings, or specify a minimum lot size as many suburbs do.</li>
<li>Highway subsidies, like the way we build roads with public money, lower the perceived cost of building a dispersed city. Mortgage subsidies from the federal housing association that made it easier to buy new houses than to restore or rebuild existing more central buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds pretty grim, but I look at it with optimism: if we have built this relatively wealthy society even with the boat anchor of horrible living design hanging around our necks, <em>imagine how much wealthier we will become </em>if we shed that useless burden for the next stage of our journey?</p>
<p>In fact, some people are already working on the project. A group called <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/" target="_blank">Strong Towns</a>, run by a fiscal conservative engineer named Chuck Marohn, teaches cities about the folly of car-based expansion. From his career as a city planner, he has learned that the honeymoon of developer dollars and easy borrowing quickly fades to become a hangover of massive maintenance costs and low tax revenue. A densely packed city puts a lot of people, business, and money close together. With a dispersed city you get lots of maintenance costs but very few businesses per square mile.</p>
<p>A movement called &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Urbanism" target="_blank">New Urbanism</a>&#8221; started up in 1993 to bring back some aspects of people-friendly design. There are now neighborhoods popping up with these better design principles in every major city. In Mableton, Georgia they are actually reclaiming big parking lots to build useful islands of denser development, as shown in the earlier picture.</p>
<p>But it has been a long battle, because in order to make a place that is pleasant for people, you literally need to change or disobey the existing suburban building codes.</p>
<p>Here in Longmont, there is a street called &#8220;100 Year Party Court&#8221; and another called &#8220;Tenacity&#8221;, named by some frustrated New Urban developers who were dumbfounded by how ridiculous the existing road regulations were: <em>&#8220;Why are they forcing to waste space for THIS MUCH PARKING on the streetside &#8211; what are they expecting, some sort of 100-year-party?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Thus, it is time to stop the madness and start rebuilding our ridiculous infrastructure in a smarter way.</p>
<p>The increase to our personal wealth may be larger than any other possible change we can make. We have about 9 million lane-miles of roads in the US, and over 5,000 notable bridges. It costs about <a href="http://www.artba.org/about/faq/" target="_blank">$1 million per mile</a> to make a single lane of road, which means we have at least $9 trillion of roads and $100 billion of bridges, before we even get into 500 million parking spaces, which cost about $4,000 <em>each! </em></p>
<p>By Mustachian standards, at least 90% &#8211; <em>Ninety Percent</em> &#8211; of this pavement is wasted. It&#8217;s just there to support the other sprawl, and because we have trained our citizens refuse to walk or ride a bike, even for short distances.</p>
<p><strong>How To Fix It</strong></p>
<p>The good news is that this can be fixed. The reason people keep perpetuating the pointless car model is that they are unaware there is any other option.</p>
<p>If you live in Orlando and want to go out for dinner, you see only a choice of driving, or a long, noisy walk alongside a six-lane road on a narrow grass shoulder. I was there last month and did the walk, noting that they had not even bothered with sidewalks. I could see how Orlandans would assume that cars are superior to walking, if this were their frame of reference.</p>
<p>Now that you <em>know</em> there is a better way, there are practical steps you can take as a citizen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop supporting car sprawl with your money. If a potential house, job, or store is in an area that doesn&#8217;t support bikes or walking, simply don&#8217;t sign the contract.<br />
After all, would you buy a house in an area that was impossible to reach by road? Probably not, and in fact areas like this are generally called &#8220;Wilderness&#8221;  because so many people insist on roads.<br />
Reverse your priorities and insist on living somewhere designed for Humans. There are now thousands of places like this. It&#8217;s worth the small effort to find one.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re starting or expanding your own company, do it in a walkable area. If the majority of your employees will have no choice but to drive to work, that&#8217;s a bad place to start a business.</li>
<li>Start voting <em>against</em> any road expansions in your region. Somewhat counter-intuitively, road expansions never alleviate traffic jams &#8211; they only make them worse.<br />
The <em>only</em> solution to traffic is to get people out of their cars. Luckily, this solution also costs less and builds the wealth of your local economy rather than draining it.  <strong>Road expansion is to a city like candy and cookies are to your body. It has also been described as &#8220;trying to cure obesity by loosening your belt&#8221;</strong></li>
<li>Channel that money you would have spent on roads &#8211; 100% of it &#8211; into bike paths, road diets, parks, central city redevelopment and &#8220;upzoning&#8221;.</li>
<li>Fight the &#8220;Not in My Back Yard&#8221; tendencies of most people, who object to new buildings or higher-density living near where they live. What these people are probably afraid of is not the presence of more people, but the car traffic they would bring. So, support more density, but only if it discourages cars.</li>
<li>Push for the removal of <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/18/a-map-of-cities-that-got-rid-of-parking-minimums" target="_blank">minimum parking requirements</a> for new construction. Every time somebody wants to create a new building or business, our traditional building code system forces them to waste a bunch of money and precious land on parking spaces, which sit empty most of the time.<br />
It makes much more sense to use that extra land for more businesses and housing, eliminating the vast distances that encourage people to drive in the first place. Car parking would be a niche market, built by private companies and charged out at market rates.</li>
<li>And of course, just start walking and biking wherever you can. In a dense city, and even in US-style suburban sprawl, a bike will get you there faster than a car most of the time. Sure, there are a few spots that are truly unsafe for bikes, but even <em>right now, with today&#8217;s infrastructure, </em>we could eliminate at least 75% of town and city traffic overnight.<br />
For example, here in Longmont, biking is safe and efficient to 100% of possible destinations, at least 350 days of the year. But bikes represent less than 0.5% of the traffic I see on the roads.<br />
Every time you drive within a town, you destroy a bit of the feeling of community. Every single time you walk, you build the community, and advertise the idea of walking to every person who sees you.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I learned from this book, urban planning is far from just a geeky niche topic &#8211; it&#8217;s really the foundation of most of our wealth and personal happiness.</p>
<p>We can improve everything about our lives, if we all understand a bit about how to arrange our living spaces. So I&#8217;ll see you out there this afternoon, as we start making some arrangements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>* (people who have weak bonds with their immediate neighbors will trust them less &#8211; and will also disproportionately vote for things like nationalist, anti-trade, anti-immigration policies and be worried about terrorism &#8211; sound familiar?)</em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a cool passage on this subject from the book:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Imagine that you dropped your wallet somewhere on your street. What are the chances you would get it back if a neighbor found it? A stranger? A police officer? Your answer to that simple question is a proxy for a whole list of metrics related to the quality of your relationship with family, friends, neighbors, and the society around you.

<p>Since 2014, I&#8217;ve been using the Betterment investing service for a growing portion of my own savings.  I funded an experimental account with $100,000, and have had a monthly auto-deposit adding in an additional $1000 per month since then. The results have been documented on a page I call <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/betterment-vs-vanguard/" target="_blank">The Betterment Experiment</a>.</p>
<p>So far, the experience has been better than I had expected. The company&#8217;s behavior &#8211; both to me as a customer, and through their relationship with the public and the media has been solid and classy. And their already-good investment system has continued to advance. I joined for the automatic rebalancing of shares, but since then have been impressed by two more obscure features that are surprisingly effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.betterment.com/tax-loss-harvesting/" target="_blank">tax loss harvesting</a> system, which has sliced several thousand dollars from my income tax bill so far. (Note &#8211; this feature is generally most useful only at higher income levels, and I got extra benefit from having other capital gains to offset)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.betterment.com/tax-coordinated-portfolio/" target="_blank">Tax Coordinated Portfolio Allocation</a>, which automatically shields more your of dividend-paying index funds in your IRA instead of your taxable account. I just enabled this last month and am enjoying watching the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>For people actually saving for retirement, there&#8217;s also stuff like an impressive <a href="https://www.betterment.com/retirement/" target="_blank">retirement guide system</a> and customized advice, but these are less useful to me personally.  Because this blog&#8217;s readership includes many technical and DIY-everything people, I wanted the Betterment account to stand on its numbers alone, not just feelgood convenience features.</p>
<p>I calculated that the tax-related features were easily increasing my return by over 1% per year, which easily covered Betterment&#8217;s 0.15% annual management fee. I still see many criticisms* popping up around the internet, accusing me of being a &#8220;shill&#8221; for Betterment and that everyone should just  manually run a <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio" target="_blank">Three Fund Portfolio</a> in Vanguard. But so far none of them have correctly accounted for these tax savings in their calculations &#8211; they underestimated TLH. It&#8217;s an easy oversight to make without holding a Betterment account yourself and watching the results.</p>
<p>As my positive feelings about the company grew, I continued to move more personal investments over to a second, private account at Betterment, including my old work IRA. As a result I now have about $500,000 with Betterment.</p>
<p>Logically, this was still only a partial commitment &#8211; the numbers worked out in favor of sending all my future investment dollars to Betterment, but I was still building trust in the company, so I decided to take it slowly. On top of that, my older investments (mostly with Vanguard), have gone way up in value since I made them in the early 2000s, so it would be tax-inefficient to sell them just to buy similar index funds through Betterment.</p>
<p><strong>Then, They Dropped This Bomb</strong></p>
<p><em>(Update: after writing this post, I had the opportunity to exchange several private emails with Betterment founder Jon Stein and other employees, and they were quite reassuring. He also posted a much better explanation of why they changed prices, <a href="https://www.betterment.com/resources/inside-betterment/what-weve-heard-from-our-customers-about-our-new-pricing-plans/" target="_blank">here</a>. So I have updated this section to reflect what I learned.)</em></p>
<p>On January 30th, I got a preliminary note from the company announcing that their fee structure was about to change. The original tiered price structure looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.35% on the accounts under $10,000 (with auto-deposit)</li>
<li>0.25% on accounts $10,000 to $99,999</li>
<li>0.15% on accounts over $100,000</li>
</ul>
<p>They announced an upcoming change to a flat fee, with a cap</p>
<ul>
<li>0.25% on all accounts up to $2 million</li>
<li>Free management on the portion of your balance which exceeds $2 million</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, your fee is capped at $5,000 per year.</p>
<p>They also added personal consultation services called Betterment Plus and <a href="https://www.betterment.com/resources/inside-betterment/product-news/your-money-your-way-the-betterment-advice-plans/" target="_blank">Betterment Premium</a> for higher rates, and I have heard these are welcome services for many customers. But since I greatly prefer talking to computers rather than people when it comes to the subject of money,  we&#8217;re focusing on the robo-advisor service &#8211; now called Betterment Digital &#8211; here.</p>
<p>In practice, the two fee levels look like this. The first graph shows what happens on balances up to $1 million, while the second graph is just a zoomed out version showing up to $4 million. The new fee structure will cost significantly more for the wealthier readers of this blog &#8211; it only starts to save you money at around $3.3 million in investments.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13776" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/betterment-new-fees.jpg" alt="betterment-new-fees" width="539" height="732" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/betterment-new-fees.jpg 539w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/betterment-new-fees-133x180.jpg 133w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/betterment-new-fees-221x300.jpg 221w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/betterment-new-fees-110x150.jpg 110w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></p>
<p>People with under $100,000 in their account will notice no difference. Those of us in the $100k-$2 million band will see a 66% increase in fees (starting on June 1st), then things even back out by $3.3 million.</p>
<p>In my situation (a $500,000 balance), the annual management fees jump from $750 to $1250 per year, an increase of $500.</p>
<p><strong>How do I feel About This?</strong></p>
<p>These days, I try to avoid outrage and instead think about the big picture. The price change brought up some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is the company increasing fees?</strong> Are they correcting a past mistake, having realized it&#8217;s hard to make a profit on 0.15%? Are they being opportunistic? Are they plumping up the company in preparation for sale?</li>
<li><strong>Is the service still a good value at for me 0.25%?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a risk that this will happen again?</strong> Investing large chunks of your life savings requires a <em>huge</em> amount of trust. In my opinion, this sudden price change was a violation of my trust &#8211; it sets a precedent and I wondered if it could happen at any time. Sure, you can always <a href="https://support.betterment.com/customer/portal/articles/2164220-how-do-i-transfer-my-account-out-of-betterment-" target="_blank">pull your money out at any time</a>, but this is a hassle with potential tax consequences. Good investors leave money in place for decades and don&#8217;t want to be forced to move it around.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question #1</strong> is a philosophical one. I am rooting for Betterment and I like the people who work there. In general, I try to do business exclusively with companies that pass this test. And this makes me less of a customer and more of a partner.  I <em>want</em> my business partners to make money off of their customers, including me, because that&#8217;s what will keep them in business. Being a customer should never be an adversarial relationship.</p>
<p>After talking to Jon, I learned that the price increase was a necessary thing to remain a growing and sustainable business. Doing the math, they manage $6 billion, and at 0.15% they would only collect $9 million in annual income. Far too little to go around in a firm with 100 employees. Sure, they are winning new customers quickly, but that is a very slim margin at this stage. Jon said he would prefer to <em>drop</em> prices as the company grows large enough to allow it, but first we have to get there. He also said their goal is to become an independent, public company.</p>
<p><strong>Question #2</strong> is just a math question, and the answer is Yes. It is overwhelmingly clear that my Betterment account delivers more than 0.25% net annual improvement over trying to manually approximate its performance with Vanguard ETFs. Their software is incredibly good, and just keeps getting better. The talent level of the people there is <em>insane**. </em></p>
<p><strong>Question #3</strong> was the real stumper for me. This price increase came out of nowhere, and nobody asked me for my opinion &#8211; as a customer or as a long-time promoter who has sent thousands of other customers to Betterment. When I got the short advance warning, I spent the day emailing with the marketing department and even the founder, trying to talk them out of it, because I feel that it was placing the trust of customers at an incredible risk. From my email to their team:</p>
<p><em>&#8221; the single biggest weakness that Betterment has (which it is gradually overcoming), is trust [&#8230;]When you raise prices on existing customers (and even on future customers in the middle of the customer acquisition stage) this trust is partially or completely shattered.</em></p>
<p><em>Investing millions of dollars over a lifetime requires a much more stable policy that reassures people over a period of multiple decades. The good news is that the profits are still there &#8211; one wealthy person may have the investments of one hundred or even one thousand beginner investors. But Betterment is still a brand-new company working on acquiring its first foothold of trust for larger, more conservative investors. Is this worth it?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is a human behavioral finance problem straight out of a textbook. As humans, we are subject to the cognitive bias called &#8220;Loss Aversion&#8221; &#8211; we fear and perceive the loss of what we currently have <em>much more</em> than we fear and perceive missed opportunities for much larger amounts of gain.</p>
<p>For example, which of the following two options would you prefer?</p>
<ul>
<li>an anonymous vandal does $1000 of damage to your car in the parking lot at work, or</li>
<li>you car-commute uneventfully to work for a few months &#8211; but unknowingly miss the opportunity to ride your bike, which would improve your financial picture by <em>much more than $1000?</em></li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_13779" style="width: 131px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/betterment-twitter.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-13779"><img class="wp-image-13779" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/betterment-twitter-77x300.jpg" alt="Complaints on my Twitter feed about Betterment price change - click for larger" width="121" height="471" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/betterment-twitter-77x300.jpg 77w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/betterment-twitter-46x180.jpg 46w" sizes="(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Complaints on my Twitter feed about Betterment price change &#8211; click for larger</p></div>
<p>That second option should be much more scary to every office worker, but it&#8217;s not. And yet Betterment has walked itself right into the same trap &#8211; subjecting the wealthier portion of its 200,000+ customers to loss aversion.</p>
<p><em>(Related Reading: <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/11/21/predictably-irrational/" target="_blank">here&#8217;s an earlier article about one of my favorite books of all times, called Predictably Irrational</a> &#8211; it  teaches you about more of your own flaws in a very entertaining way.)</em></p>
<p>I feel that a much better business move for Betterment would have been to spend less money on developing new features, in order to be able to leave the existing price structure in place.</p>
<p>But given the current path, I now think the biggest problem was the way they communicated the price change. It was mentioned in passing as part of a cheerful &#8220;Look what&#8217;s new at Betterment!&#8221; email to customers. It&#8217;s the communication style we have come to expect from Verizon or Comcast, but not from a place as genuine and authentic as Betterment.</p>
<p>You could see the pain in the passionate essays that customers immediately sent to my email inbox this week, and in the responses to something I put on Twitter. One guy even started a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/support-betterment-com-unacceptable-fee-change-by-betterment" target="_blank">petition on change.org</a> in an attempt to communicate customer dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The net result for me will probably be no change. I&#8217;ll leave the Betterment Experiment running, and continue to deposit the $1000 per month, because that&#8217;s exactly  what an experiment is for &#8211; I leave it running so we all get to watch the long-term results.</p>
<p>I still plan to transfer more into my private account over the next year, but I will make a point of reviewing the other robo-advisers and competing services from Wealthfront, Schwab, Vanguard, and WiseBanyan in order for this blog to be less Betterment-specific. My trust was shaken and then mostly reassured in this case, but I don&#8217;t want readers in this blog to follow in my footsteps without considering all the options independently.</p>
<p>An investment company making management fee increase is a very small deal in the grand scheme of things. But it is a big deal to me because I really try to keep my recommendations useful.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>* To these critics I say &#8220;I respect your hardcore Vanguard chops but please try to separate Bogleheads ideology (which holds that anything not Vanguard is automatically Evil)  from the actual numbers. Beating the market is not a viable goal, but reducing account-holder mistakes and reducing taxes is much riper area to harvest. Betterment only has to accomplish this at an 0.25% annual rate to justify their fee. </em></p>
<p><em>** Observe<a href="https://www.betterment.com/resources/research/tax-coordinated-portfolio-white-paper/" target="_blank"> this white paper</a> they published explaining the details of new Tax Coordinated portfolio.  They just operate on a higher technical plane than other companies.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure: Betterment&#8217;s real relationship to MMM</strong> &#8211; After I invested with them in 2014, I also joined their affiliate program as I do with any product I use and like (see my <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/affiliates/" target="_blank">Affiliate policy</a>). Then I got kicked out, because more recent SEC rules state that you cannot be an affiliate while also having a &#8220;testimonial&#8221; review.  I felt a review is useless if you can&#8217;t report on your own experience, so I decided to leave the program so I could leave my review up. No problem, of course &#8211; my goal is to never let affiliation affect my recommendations as there is plenty of money in life either way. Later, Betterment paid to have flat-rate advertising on this site, and that program may or may not continue  &#8211; this article might make me a less desirable advertising platform, and I didn&#8217;t check with anyone before publishing it.</em></p>

There was more than enough room for everyone, it was in a walkable neighborhood, and thanks to some unexpected boosts in our family income, life was more affordable than ever.</p>
<p>But suddenly, perhaps due to some combination of a romantic whim* and the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/05/15/the-principle-of-constant-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quest for constant optimization</a>, we decided to downsize to a house that was about 50% smaller.</p>
<p>While the above-ground space only dropped by a couple hundred square feet (from 1734 to 1532), this move also cost me my nicely finished basement, a warm dry attached double garage, a garden shed, plus a nifty &#8220;tiny house&#8221; building I had built out back. The total pain was thus much larger: my almost-3200 square feet of dry indoor space was cut down by more than half.</p>
<p>I use the word &#8220;my&#8221; because in our family, I really am the main consumer of space. While my share of bedroom and closet space is minimal, I am responsible for a bulky drum set, too much audio and computer equipment, most of the bikes, and of course the whole Confused Renaissance Man&#8217;s set of tools for working on houses, gardens, metal and electronics. And of course, the accompanying materials and salvaged scraps are even bigger than the equipment itself. I&#8217;m a living contradiction because in some ways, being a Maker is the opposite of being a Minimalist.</p>
<p>So, moving to this new house came with one condition: I could survive the compression if I could <em>at least </em>build something about the size of a garage &#8211; to function as a place to work, think, create loud music of questionable quality,  and spread out my big messy projects.</p>
<p>Thus, before even signing the contract to buy the place, I checked with the city&#8217;s building department to make sure I could squeeze this future building legally onto the lot. They approved the idea, so after getting the main house mostly built, I broke ground in April 2016 to start building The Studio.</p>
<p>Sometime in the fall of that year, I declared this new Mancave mostly done, and <strong>this</strong> is in fact the first full article that I will have typed inside the structure. Thus, I thought it would be the perfect time to share some of the decisions, numbers, and lessons learned from this project.</p>
<p>After all, nearly every home buying quest brings up the question: &#8220;Could I add extra space onto this old house? If so, what would it look like and how much would it cost?&#8221; &#8211; Often the best-located houses are in the older and more central neighborhoods, built during an era when a family would happily squeeze into 800 square feet and share a single bathroom. It&#8217;s a noble goal if you&#8217;re tough enough, but for those of us who prefer a fancier pad (myself included), a few modifications can make all the difference.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a rapidfire recount of the process I went through to build the Studio:</p>
<p><strong>Design: </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_13727" style="width: 527px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-13727" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015-1024x681.jpg" alt="The main house (always in progress), as it looked in early 2016" width="517" height="344" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015-900x599.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/back-patio-2015.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The back of main house (always in progress), as it looked in early 2016. We wanted the studio to go along with this basic style.</p></div>
<p>I wanted something with similar style to the simple midcentury modern lines I stuck with for the main house: a single-plane roof with substantial overhangs, and big windows on the South side to let in the sun. After doing some sketches, we happened to find a local kit-building company called <a href="https://www.studio-shed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio Shed</a> that offered almost same design. The benefit of a kit is that all the materials come in one package, which saves a load of shopping and ordering work, plus the wall segments come partially pre-assembled.</p>
<p>I weighed the convenience of the Studio Shed prefab kit against the extra cost, which was fairly high. But I still ended up buying the kit in the end, partly as an experiment to report on the prefab experience to <em>you, </em>and partly because I am trying to value my time more highly these days. The purchase would eliminate most of the boring administrative work: shopping for materials, getting quotes and placing orders, coordinating with a structural engineer, and getting materials to my building site.</p>
<p>Since extra money will no longer help me these days, it helps to take money out of the decisions and think about where time would best be spent. So I bought something called the &#8220;Summit Series 16 x 22&#8221; with a few nice customizations.</p>
<p><strong>Layout and Digging: </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stringlines.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignleft wp-image-13728 size-medium" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stringlines-225x300.jpg" alt="stringlines" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stringlines-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stringlines-135x180.jpg 135w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stringlines-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stringlines.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>This decision went the opposite way of the Studio Shed kit purchase: since I had never laid out a foundation, dug the actual hole, created large concrete forms or built a complex rebar structure, I decided to do all this stuff myself so I could learn a few more new trades.</p>
<p>I used tape measures, plus the existing lot survey and structures to figure out where to pound in stakes and pull some tight strings. Once everything was verified, I used bright orange ground marking spray paint to clearly define my digging lines.</p>
<p>Then the fun part began: I walked down to the local equipment rental shop and inquired about how a man might go about renting an excavating machine. It turned out that they&#8217;ll lend one out to anybody, as long as you&#8217;ve got the money. Why did I wait over 40 years to learn this amazing thing about our country?</p>
<p>I only needed a 3 foot deep trench with roughly 16&#8243; width, and it turns out that even the smallest digger can dig down to 8 feet, so I rented a John Deere 17G. Rental rate is a little under $200 per day, but you also need to transport the 3800 lb machine to your house. Not owning a heavy equipment trailer, I paid the shop an extra $80 for drop-off and pick-up service. With taxes and fees it was around $300 in total.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13729" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator-1024x681.jpg" alt="mini-excavator" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator-900x599.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mini-excavator.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Note: I had never driven an excavating machine before. But it&#8217;s just like a simple video game with a few levers to control the joints: three for the arm, two for the treads, plus one lever for the body swivel and a final one to control the small but surprisingly useful bulldozer blade. I was able to get a pretty straight, tidy foundation hole (really more of a &#8220;footing trench&#8221; in this case) in only a single day of work. There was plenty of time to spare and the machine burned through less than two gallons of diesel ($5) over the course of the day.</p>
<p>After digging the hole successfully I taught my son to use the machine and he was able to load the 6000 pound dirt pile nicely into an open-top trailer for transfer to our front garden.</p>

<p>After the machine digging, I set the strings back up and went back through with a shovel to fine tune the depth and positioning of the trench. My son made a nifty timelapse video of the process and even wrote some music for it &#8211; <a href="https://youtu.be/Ax5PbsIy7uE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch it on YouTube</a> if you like.</p>
<p><strong>Forms and Rebar</strong></p>
<p>This was a great challenge for me, because precise foundations are inherently tricky: you have the imprecise medium of rough soil, combined with heavy wood or steel forms and reinforcement bars that are hard to work with. And all this needs to withstand the force of a 30,000 pound liquid concrete delivery that must be distributed and smoothed quickly as soon as it arrives. But the end result must be precise to within an eighth of an inch, and dead level across the span of your entire structure. As a beginner, I had to invent various shims and jigs to make the adjustments. It was particularly fun to figure out how to bend and weld up a complex 3-d mesh of rebar to match the structural engineer&#8217;s specifications (and pass an inspection!):</p>
<div id="attachment_13737" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-13737" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-1024x768.jpg" alt="rebar_jig" width="510" height="383" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-900x675.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig-320x240.jpg 320w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rebar_jig.jpg 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the four overlapping walls of rebar that I had to create.</p></div>
<p>A builder&#8217;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2ko34J7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transit level </a>(borrowed from a friend) was absolutely essential for getting the form positioning correct, and lots of fun to use as well.</p>
<p>I put some rough timelapses on YouTube of these stages as well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI8Wkm3MecI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building a form wall</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci5tLp3nWWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installing it</a> alongside the other three walls.</p>
<p>In the end it looked like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_13732" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-13732" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-1024x768.jpg" alt="foundation_with_rebar" width="502" height="377" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-900x675.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar-320x240.jpg 320w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/foundation_with_rebar.jpg 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Here is the final form, filled with rebar, radiant heating tubes, and even rough-in plumbing for a possible future small bathroom just in case. Note my haphazard reinforcement to compensate for overly flimsy forms. In the future I would make them more like walls: full 3/4&#8243; plywood screwed to full studs on 16&#8243; centers. You can always unscrew and reuse the wood later, as I did with all this stuff.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pouring a Truck Full of Cement</strong></p>
<p>Concrete is another dark art that is worth learning. Think about it: it&#8217;s <em>liquid stone </em>that can be formed into any shape, then can last for hundreds of years with no maintenance once it cures. Yet it costs only 5 cents per pound if you buy it in bags, even less if you order a truckload for delivery. Shortcut: ask for &#8220;4000 PSI mix with a 6&#8243; slump, fly ash added to slow curing time.&#8221; You order it by the cubic yard and each truck load holds 10 cubic yards, so you can do the math in advance and sound smarter on the phone.</p>
<p>My foundation and 6&#8243; thick floor slab required about 15 cubic yards worth, which cost me $2176 in total. The base price of $145 per cubic yard was much higher than I&#8217;ve paid in the past, but all the local companies were in that range &#8211; blame it on the building boom.</p>
<p>This was my third large concrete pour. It&#8217;s a fun, intense type of work. The basic procedure is to recruit at least three friends, work with them to fill the form uniformly with the truck&#8217;s chute plus some wheelbarrows, then scrape off the top with a long, rigid piece of metal to get a flat surface. Then work the surface several times over the next few hours with trowels of increasing precision to smooth it out more.</p>
<p>My Youtube timelapse of the part of the second truckload: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Beia9yYQnBw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pouring and smoothing the concrete</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly (also known as Framing) </strong></p>
<p>Once you have a flat, solid slab of concrete that has hardened for a few days, the job is much easier &#8211; you&#8217;re just framing a very small house. Which sounds fairly advanced, but if read a book on the subject or intern with a skilled framer for a day, you&#8217;ll get the picture.</p>
<p>The Studio Shed kit presented a mixture of advantages and disadvantages in this stage: because the wall segments are bulky and can weigh up to 350 pounds, you really need four people just to unload the delivery truck. Then, you have 10,000 pounds of bulky wall modules, lumber and siding scattered around your yard until you put it all together. On the positive side, the assembly process was slightly faster than manual framing and did not require quite as much knowledge.</p>

Timelapse: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjGzDevyClc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembling the walls</a></p>
<p>The roof comes completely unassembled, so the process was the same as building any other house roof: set the rafters in place and secure them with endless blocking and hurricane ties, heft up the sheets of 3/4&#8243; roofing plywood, fire in a few hundred nails, then move on to roofing paper and final roofing material (we used a metal roof in this case, because <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/03/24/how-to-install-a-metal-roof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metal roofs rock</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Finish and Electrical work</strong></p>
<p>To finish out a building like this, you need exterior siding and interior finish materials. This particular Studio Shed came with a very modern kit of painted cement board panels and aluminum accent pieces. The style was something I had never built before, so I feel I learned a few new tricks that I can use elsewhere. The downside is that it was incredibly labor intensive compared to other siding materials &#8211; lots of precision required to get it all to work out properly.</p>
<p><strong>Super Insulation for Sound and Temperature</strong></p>
<p>After that, I insulated the structure meticulously with a combination of rigid foam, canned spray foam for the cracks, and batt insulation for the bulk of the building. I used heavy 5/8&#8243; Type X drywall on all surfaces for more thermal mass and soundproofing. I even coated  the foundation with 1&#8243; rigid foil-backed foam insulation before backfilling the hole, to allow the concrete slab to function as an efficient chunk of <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/09/01/what-is-thermal-mass-and-how-can-it-make-you-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thermal mass</a> for stable temperatures year-round.  The building has gone through a hot summer and now most of a winter, requiring no air conditioning and very little supplemental heat (I set it up as an individual zone on the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/02/16/the-radiant-heat-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiant heat system</a> I built for the main house).</p>
<p><strong>My First Ever DIY Garage Door</strong></p>

I wanted lots of glass on mine, so I priced out a couple of fancy glass/aluminum garage doors like you see on patio restaurants or fire station garages.  The estimates were coming in around $2000 including installation, for a door that was not even well-insulated. I was also concerned about the overhead track cluttering up my precious high sloped ceiling. So I decided to try something new &#8211; making my own pair of side-hinged doors from welded 1&#8243; x 3&#8243;steel and thick plexiglas, with a wood interior.</p>
<p>The result was better than I could have hoped: the doors fit very tightly and have not warped at all since I built them six months ago (a huge advantage of steel over wood), and I created a weathertight design much like a standard exterior door.  Total cost was $300 and about 8 hours of work. Thermal performance seems great as well &#8211; no noticeable draft even on the coldest nights.</p>
<p><strong> A Serene New Life with the Studio</strong></p>

<p>The experience of building this thing was worthwhile in its own right: lots of education, Zen-like days of problem solving and hard outdoor labor. From a financial perspective, it&#8217;s probably a good investment, as I spent less than $100 per finished square foot, while the per-square-foot value of houses in this area is well over $300. This might yield a &#8220;profit&#8221; of roughly $60,000 when I eventually sell this house. But the real benefit has come from actually putting the thing to use.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I have a warm, dry indoor space in which to roll a snowy mountain bike on a winter night. I also used up some scrap materials to add this seven-bike outdoor garage to the otherwise-unused North wall:</p>
<div id="attachment_13742" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-13742" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage-1024x684.jpg" alt="Seven bikes that can now stay dry without taking up precious indoor space." width="523" height="350" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage-1024x684.jpg 1024w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage-300x201.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage-900x602.jpg 900w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bike-garage.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Seven bikes that can now stay dry without taking up precious indoor space.</p></div>
<p>And an incredibly quiet place to retreat and write or read, when the main house becomes a zoo. And a soundproof place for the newly revived funk band to play whenever we want, without any worry of disturbing family or neighbors. As a result, I&#8217;ve played more music with friends (and even with my son) in the past six months than I had in the previous six years.</p>
<p><strong>By the Numbers: Building a Detached Studio</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish up with a rough summary of typical costs for a project like this in a midrange region of the US , with my spending in the second column from the right.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/studio-costs.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13745" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/studio-costs.jpg" alt="studio-costs" width="549" height="446" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/studio-costs-200x163.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/studio-costs-300x245.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/studio-costs-150x122.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in the end, it&#8217;s about 31 grand and a lot of good hard work, for a building that will pay ongoing productivity dividends and then return more than its cost when it is eventually sold. Overall, building this structure has been one of my happier projects in the last decade, and it&#8217;s one that I can recommend as an alternative to looking for a bigger house if you need to expand a little.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><em>* The whim in this case was a desire to rebuild an old 1959 house almost from scratch, as well as an even-better location: still within walking distance to everything, but also on a quiet circle with a mostly unused public park as the back yard. An extra 1.4 acres of free land, maintained automatically by the city!</em></p>

I called the post <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/11/14/eulogy-to-a-great-dad/" target="_blank">Eulogy to a Great Dad</a>. It was one of my favorite stories, because it was apparent through his son&#8217;s words that this man had really devoted his life to being a good father and a good person in general.</p>
<p>Dad stories are also particularly meaningful to me because it&#8217;s my own primary mission in life right now. My main motivation for retiring early was a desire to put that role as the top thing in my life. At age 30, I set aside 20 years for this project with a goal of being cool, understanding and infinitely supportive to any kids I might have, with anything else coming a distant second. Now eleven years into that project, it remains the one thing in my current life that I manage to stick to without any compromise, and thus without any regret.</p>
<p>Lots of this was inspired by warm memories from my own upbringing. Our entire family, while not the glamorous and self-actualized group of perfect humans they used to make TV shows about, was still way up there on the happy outcomes scale. My Dad was a big part of that, always thoughtful and non-judgemental, encouraging learning and healthy behavior and frugal living through his presence in the household. Although my parents ended up separating in the early 1990s, they finished most of the hard work of raising us four kids first, and I know how much work that must have been.</p>
<p>The highlights of this father-and-son relationship revolve around music, writing, learning and travel. My Dad had been a musical semi-genius since birth, and as a result our childhood came with free impromptu concerts every day. He was always disappearing to play some badass jazz piano on the glossy black 1974 Yamaha upright, or picking effortlessly on the acoustic guitar, occasionally throwing in formal or silly lyrics with his fine tenor voice. In the 1980s, he let me move the family stereo system permanently into my bedroom to nurture my own budding love of Music All The Time. All four of his kids now place music at the top of their list of favorite things in life.</p>
<p>In 1983 he reached the age of 40, and bought a red and black Kawasaki motorcycle, joking it was a frugal way to address a midlife crisis. I was 9 years old at the time, and that summer we embarked on a long roadtrip down to Kentucky &#8211; just the two of us, with just some saddle bags full of clothes and picnic supplies. I still remember every detail of that trip &#8211; the thrill of highway travel with the asphalt rushing just below your feet, the novelty of crossing the US border and the stern nature of the officer who questioned us, the steep winding road to the Best Western hotel on a panoramic hilltop, and a week of spelunking and guided tours in the wild underground world of Mammoth Cave National park. Decades later, we would both still cite that Father and Son Adventure of Questionable Safety as one of the highlights of both of our lives.</p>
<p>Eventually all of us kids grew up, and our relationships remained loving and open. We&#8217;re oddballs in the sense that we don&#8217;t tend to remember each other&#8217;s birthdays, or remember to make the right phone calls or send the right greeting cards, but once reunited we resume the deepest and most interesting conversations as if we had never left the room a year earlier.</p>
<p>Starting this blog in 2011 brought an unexpected boost in my friendship with my dad, as he was one of the first subscribers and continued to read every article as they came out. He would often send me his thoughts on posts he enjoyed &#8211; searching my email reveals at least 50 such emails, with titles like &#8220;Latest MMM&#8221; or &#8220;Current Column.&#8221; He even participated occasionally in the writing, once sharing this <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/03/03/guest-post-shaving-lessons-from-grandpa-money-mustache/" target="_blank">post about frugal shaving</a>, and another time interacting <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/09/what-if-everyone-became-frugal/#comment-22779" target="_blank">playfully</a> in the comments section with my sister as if they were not related. Like me, he connected more deeply with people through writing and his own career was as a writer of advertising, editorials, books, and articles.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from Dad, and he claimed to learn a few things as he watched me grow into adulthood as well. Noticing the heavy emotional burden that negative thoughts would place on my life as early as high school, I deliberately became an optimist instead, reading self-development books and experimentally applying their principles to the world. The stuff actually worked, and he noted the ongoing benefits of what I called <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/10/03/the-practical-benefits-of-outrageous-optimism/" target="_blank">Outrageous Optimism</a>, as he watched things happen in my life that he had formerly assumed were not possible. He decided he should work a bit more on optimism as well.</p>
<p>During university, he let me move into the spare bedroom in his apartment which was near the campus, and I enjoyed teaching him weight training and physical fitness while he taught me about stock investing and jazz piano chords. Those two years of being adult roommates were a valuable finish to my time of growing up as his son.</p>
<p>It was a good thing that all these good things happened during our lives together, because in October of 2016, he started having some difficulties with certain words, prompting his caring wife to start keeping track of unusual occurrences in a dated journal. His appetite shrank a little, and he lost a few pounds from his already-slim frame.</p>
<p>One day, in a slow-motion piece of cinematic tragedy, his wedding ring slid off of a narrowing ring finger as he walked through a parking lot, and it turned out to be lost forever, like the growing number of words he could no longer quite bring to mind.</p>
<p>He checked into a hospital, where they scanned his head and found that a dark mass had formed within.</p>
<p>When I went back to Canada to visit him in that hospital, I could hardly believe he was sick. He looked just fine &#8211; same alert eyes set in friendly wrinkles, the same compact and upright body, and the same familiar voice. But he was also significantly different &#8211; focused oddly on the present and with very little concept of the future.  He was able to understand advanced conversations and free from worry, but with quite a bit of difficulty expressing concepts or figuring out how to find his place in a book.</p>
<p>The problem was a rare but incredibly tough form of brain tumor called Glioblastoma. Affecting people seemingly at random, this type of cancer builds itself into a lump in your head that grows very rapidly, crowding out the blood circulation that allows your normal thought processes to take place. Patients of this form of cancer live only a few months to a couple of years, depending on whether or not you can slow it down with surgery and radiation.</p>
<p>These last few months were tough, as this brilliant, witty man faded quickly to become a confused, sleepy person with limited speech and recognition, who then faded purely to sleep. His last systems finally shut down on the evening of January 13th, thankfully in an extremely peaceful hospice with loved ones nearby.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all sad, of course, but also much more grateful than I would have imagined. Although cut short by a decade or two, our Dad&#8217;s life overall was one of a lucky person. Like the first Great Dad at the start of this article, Dad&#8217;s four children and the loving wife that survives him have great respect for the way he lived, and his six grandchildren will have only fond memories of a man of readily offered kindness.</p>
<p>For my part, his sudden passing has shaken up my life. Originally shocked and depressed to hear what was happening to him, I eventually passed on to accept reality, and also become much more aware of what mortality really means. I&#8217;ve lived a long time already, and it has been quite an experience. But it really could end at any moment, and even if I evade disaster, the odds say I&#8217;ve used up a full 50% of my lifespan.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more notably, I&#8217;m suddenly on the tipping point between the labels &#8220;young guy&#8221; and &#8220;middle-aged man.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been a young adult forever, and this is the first time in life I&#8217;ve realized that stage can actually end. This means that it would be foolish for me to waste any of it, and I am suddenly much more hesitant to let any days go to waste.</p>
<p>If you found out this evening that you only had one month to live, imagine how deeply you would crave that warm carefree phase of your life that came just before &#8211; when the supply of healthy days seemed unlimited and you could do anything. That unlimited supply of life, which you took for granted and wasted on unnecessary arguments and commuting and television, would suddenly seem like the most precious and unattainable luxury in the world.</p>
<p>I realized that for now, I <strong><em>am</em></strong> still in that happy, carefree summer of unlimited life. I still <em>have</em> the luxury that my Dad lost so suddenly, and holy shit do I feel lucky to have it now. So I&#8217;m going to get up and enjoy a lot more good times while this sun shines.</p>

<p><strong>Afterword:</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the living descendants and many memories in everyone he knew, my Dad left behind plenty of written words and even some music. We found his little digital studio recorder sitting on top of that same black Yamaha piano, which still sits in the house where his wife now lives, newly alone. The memory card contained five beautiful little songs he had been working on recently, and they captured his memory for me above all other mementos.</p>
<p>I can hear his soul perfectly in the timing of every one of these notes, and see his hands, still infinitely nimble after 73 years, hitting the black and white keys as they flew across the piano, powered by a mind that had thought in terms of music since 1943.</p>
<p>I have uploaded a copy here just in case you want to put on some headphones and play it for yourself. These songs didn&#8217;t have names, but my sister decided this one can be called &#8220;Stars&#8221;</p>

<p>If you look around on the street these days, you might get the impression that it is really, really difficult to stay in shape beyond the age of about 30.</p>
<p>Sure, there are a few competitive athletes, movie stars and Navy SEALs around that still manage to keep in strong form, but if you are not willing to devote your entire life to training, you might as well just head straight for the stretch pants, right? Older age strikes and there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, if you could peer at the financial statements of your fellow citizens, the story might be similar: consumer <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/18/news-flash-your-debt-is-an-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt is normal</a>, the bills keep piling up, and only the movie stars and athletes (and corrupt CEOs of big banks, of course) make enough money to actually get ahead.</p>
<p>These opinions are widespread, and often fiercely defended as Truth. This is why I have been happily surprised over the years as I discovered that the prevailing wisdom is completely wrong: it&#8217;s not only <em>possible</em> to become wealthy on an average salary, it is just a natural byproduct of living a healthy life. Similarly, you don&#8217;t need a crushing workout schedule, a $250 per month gym or a team of professional trainers to be in very good shape. You just need to focus on the basics and avoid the worst pitfalls.</p>
<p>But as the years go on and I talk to more and more people, I realize that very few people even <em>know</em> these basics, and they think some of the pitfalls (for example drinking a big glass of orange juice with breakfast) are actually healthy life choices. So with New Year&#8217;s Resolution time approaching, I thought we could dish out some of this old school knowledge right now.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s use plain old Mr. Money Mustache as an example. I&#8217;m an average 42-year-old white nerd who has never played a competitive sport in his life. I made my career in office work and enjoy beer a bit more than I should. And yet I feel great &#8211; despite the fact that I keep getting older and live a deprived life without the personal trainer or private chef that every wealthy person really deserves.</p>
<p>Even worse, I don&#8217;t even have a gym membership, and the months I spend away from home every year have been compromising my access to even the basic backyard <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/17/get-rich-with-olympic-barbells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barbell set</a> that comprises my only fitness equipment. I have spent about 2 of the past 5 months away from home, which means a lot of time with no gym in sight.</p>
<p>All of these factors, yet all systems seem to be better than ever. Returning from the latest travel binge, I found roughly the same level of strength and bodyfat while keeping the same overall weight on the scale. How can this be?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fitness as a Part of Life<br />
</strong><strong> </strong>(rather than something you do at the gym)</p>
<p>Far too often in modern life, we cut an artificial line between the ideas of getting in shape and everything else we do. People train for Ironman events, but then drive a car for local errands. They use the stair machine in the gym, but then take the elevator up to the 12th floor in the office building. They claim that getting in shape is important, but then drive their kids to school in the morning in one of the world&#8217;s most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrxxX-59b58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ridiculous spectacles</a> of Car Clown behavior.</p>
<p>We sit still at work, sit in automobiles, and stand still with rolling luggage on the airport escalator to avoid the strain of the staircase, and hire contractors to take care of our lawns and shovel our driveways. And then we wonder why we get fat, or injure our knees and backs, or get any other less-than-satisfactory performance from our bodies. Only the most dedicated workout junkies (rebranded as CrossFitters these days) seem to get anywhere, and even they often fall off the wagon and become mortals eventually.</p>
<p>I feel that there&#8217;s a better way to get good health results, but with much more efficiency than what most people achieve right now. You could boil it down to the philosophy of &#8220;use it or lose it&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Principles of Efficient Physical Fitness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not everybody likes the act of exercising itself, but everybody likes being in shape. The key to getting the latter without having to commit your life to flawless execution of the former is to understand the concept of <em>exercise efficiency</em> &#8211; getting the best results with minimum time and minimum risk of failing due to bad habits.</p>
<p><strong>Principle Zero: Moving is Normal, Sitting Still is Hazardous</strong><br />
Before we even begin, we need to make a change to the most basic paradigm of modern life. Most of us sit or lie down almost constantly: to sleep, eat, work, drive, and even (shudder) to watch TV. Instead, I like to think of sitting as something you do as a short break from your real life. And you should feel just a bit uncomfortable when sitting down, because it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/national/the-health-hazards-of-sitting/750/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">really is a hazardous activity</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever you get a chance to move, take it: get up and pace around while you read books. Attend your conference calls with a mobile phone headset while out walking along the river. Cut your own lawn. Walk the 5 miles across town that you would normally drive. Always, always take the stairs. Never, ever use a drive-through. You can even try taping your laptop to the drink platform of a treadmill and working as you pace slowly along at 1 MPH (I have tried this and it is amazing).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of taking on a job that requires more than a few minutes of car driving per day, consider this equivalent to accepting a job in an Asbestos mine or an old Russian nuclear power plant. You might still do it, but only if the benefits greatly outweigh the obvious costs. Similarly, if you&#8217;re considering spending an afternoon on the couch watching football, pretend that you have to wear an inhaler that dispenses just a tiny dose of Cyanide into each breath. With this comparison in mind, you can decide if you still weight the passive entertainment more highly than, say, taking your kids out to play in the park.</p>
<p>On really good days, I might spend 4-10 hours walking or biking  around for various reasons like errands, carpentry, and just plain old strolls, and these really good days result in incredible happiness. On days when I fail to obey this Principle of Constant Movement, I instantly devolve into a more average and grumpy person.</p>

So instead I keep this squat rack just outside my back door, to eliminate psychological barriers to the most important exercise. Mud, snow, hot, cold &#8211; it&#8217;s all good for you &#8211; just do some damned squats, at least a couple times per week.</p></div>
<p><strong>Principle #1: Building Muscle is Far More Effective than Cardiovascular Training</strong><br />
I think the most common beginner fitness mistake in the world might be when people decide to start jogging or other aerobic exercises as a method of weight loss. Double Fail Points if you go for a treadmill or a stationary bike while watching TV inside a smelly commercial gym.</p>
<p>So many people slave away at these cardio-related things like aerobics classes and treadmills and still look almost the same several months later. Most of them end up quitting as they lose motivation in the face of the poor results. And then the weight loss industry is right there waiting, saying they must have just bought the wrong diet shakes. Or the &#8220;accept yourself as you are&#8221; movement tells them that body composition change is impossible, so you should give up.</p>
<p>The real reason for the failure is that cardio training activities (while great for your heart) are very poor at triggering the growth of muscle tissue. You pump the heart and breathe vigorously and burn a few calories during that brief session, but then the session ends and you&#8217;re back to your regular self.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who lift or move heavy things get triple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same heart and lung bonus up front as they lift weights and break down existing muscle tissue</li>
<li>The massive calorie implosion required to rebuild those muscles to a new, stronger size</li>
<li>Then a permanent ongoing burn required to maintain that fine new stronger form</li>
</ul>
<p>As Tim Ferriss demonstrates in <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2gHRPYN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Four Hour Body</a></em>, it is possible for a relative beginner to trigger over a pound of muscle growth (3500 calories of body composition change) with just one brief session of barbell squats.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that in different terms: <strong>you exceed the calorie burn you&#8217;d get from 4-8 hours of riding a stationary bike in the gym, in about 4-8 <em>minutes, </em>by warming up your legs and then performing a few sets of 5 squats, working up to a weight that is fairly difficult for you.</strong></p>
<p>To clarify this after many angry and skeptical comments below: YES, the squats themselves burn only a few dozen calories. But by breaking down the tissues of your largest compound muscle group including quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteus, and a plenty of assisting muscles, you force your body to rebuild the entire set bigger and stronger. This is an incredibly calorically-intense process which can take almost a full week to complete. Thus, the total net energy cost ends up being several thousand calories.</p>
<p>Calorie testing on myself over the years confirms these figures are roughly correct &#8211; hell hath no appetite like that of a person who has done his or her squats properly. As long as you refuel from this hunger in a strategic manner, you&#8217;ll find your fat reserves getting vacuumed away at high speed.</p>
<p>How do we take advantage of this? Start thinking about <strong>feats of peak strength</strong> rather than the conventional 30-minute periods of sweaty endurance training on a stationary bike.</p>
<p><strong>Principle #2: Every Bodypart, Whenever Possible<br />
</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_13584" style="width: 328px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/your-muscles.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-13584" src="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/your-muscles.jpg" alt="These are your muscles. Understand the big groups, then work them regularly." width="318" height="237" srcset="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/your-muscles.jpg 477w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/your-muscles-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/your-muscles-300x223.jpg 300w, http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/your-muscles-150x112.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These are your muscles. Understand the big groups, then work them regularly.</p></div>
<p>Most people think of exercise as all one big interchangeable thing: &#8220;I get plenty of exercise walking my dogs and gardening&#8221;, or, &#8220;I was able to drop my gym membership because I bike to work now.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the wrong way to think about it.</p>
<p>Sure, mild exercise is still far better than sitting still. But you get much better results if you think about each muscle group and make sure <strong>you have overloaded it recently</strong>, thus sending it the message to become stronger.</p>
<p>As a start, you could think of your body as having five groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Back</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chest and triceps </strong>(your &#8220;pushing muscles&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>Upper Back and biceps</strong> (any time you find yourself &#8220;pulling&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>Core </strong>(all the complex muscles that hold you together at the middle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, how will you overload each group at least a little bit, every day or two?</p>
<p>If you like to go to a gym, and you use the free weight room instead of the inefficient cardio stuff, great. Through my teens and 20s, I was on this plan and it went well. But after getting married, then becoming a father, I found that long stretches of time would pass as I became complacent and made excuses. This is not great &#8211; to improve from wherever you are now, you need <em>every muscle group </em>to be blasted down with reasonable exertion (enough to cause at least a tiny bit of soreness) &#8211; <em>every week.</em></p>
<p>To translate the vague concept of muscle groups into practical exercises you can do in many places, here&#8217;s a guide of my favorite exercises. You can look these up anywhere to get the basics of how to do each movement safely. For example, Google &#8220;How to Do Squats&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Legs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Squats (with just your own weight when getting started. Then with barbells, or one-legged if no barbells available)</li>
<li>Deadlifts</li>
<li>Jumping on or off of anything (including <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/27/nicer-legs-and-some-new-carpentry-skills-for-only-15-bucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boxes like this one</a>)</li>
<li>Running up and down stairs</li>
<li>Sprinting around anywhere</li>
<li>Urban Parkour-style hooliganism with friends when visiting any city</li>
<li>Note that my daily cycling doesn&#8217;t count as a real leg exercise, since it&#8217;s a heart-building rather than muscle-building exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Back:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pullups from any bar or overhanging surface. You can assist yourself with your legs if you&#8217;re not yet strong enough to do real pull-ups.</li>
<li>Barbell or dumbell rows</li>
<li>Pulling any heavy item from the ground to your chest while you&#8217;re bent over.</li>
<li>Snow shoveling, digging trenches, chopping wood, moving bags of concrete</li>
<li>And anything else that feels like hard work is probably good for your back.</li>
<li>The Deadlift, mentioned under &#8220;Legs&#8221;, is also great for your lower back.<br />
But build this strength up slowly if you&#8217;re untrained &#8211; we&#8217;ve all heard stories about unfit people who &#8220;throw out their backs&#8221; when lifting something after years of deadly inactivity. The goal here is to make your back unbreakable &#8211; for life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chest and Triceps: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the Clean and Press (lift a barbell from the ground to over your head &#8211; my second favorite exercise in the world after squats).</li>
<li>bench press</li>
<li>dumbbell press<br />
(these first three are generally only if I&#8217;m lucky enough to be at home)</li>
<li>dips</li>
<li>pushups</li>
<li>On the road, the barbells are unavailable so I try to increase to 100 pushups per day, and using any available parallel surface, inside corner of a kitchen countertop, or pair of posts for dips.</li>
<li>To increase resistance, you can get a friend or loved one to sit on your back during pushups: 8 insanely hard pushups are better for you than 50 easy ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core: </strong></p>
<p>The benefit of doing real-world exercise (especially sprinting) instead of lame treadmills at the gym, is that it forces you to flex and stabilize all your abdomen and oblique muscles and make them stronger. But you can still target the core directly with a few of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planks (hover your body flat and still with only forearms and toes touching the ground for 60-300 seconds)</li>
<li>Leg-raises while hanging from a bar, tree branch, or anything else</li>
<li>Twisting or jumping motions of any sort</li>
<li>Situps and abdominal crunches</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note: core and abdominal muscles do <em>not</em> help you lose abdominal fat any faster than any other exercise. The fastest way to lose fat (after fixing your diet) is to accelerate calorie burn, which means triggering muscle growth. So if you want better abs, do squats.</p>
<p><strong>Principle #3: <em>Resisting</em> Heavy Motion Delivers The Results</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Consider the following counter-intuitive trick: walking <em>down</em> a flight of stairs <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delivers</a> much better strength and muscle-building results than walking <em>up </em>that same flight of stairs, even though going down is much easier. I learned this amazing shortcut just a few years ago, but it has allowed me to get better results in less time ever since.</p>
<p>To put it into practice, you can bend your legs more deeply when going down stairs or hills, lower your body more slowly during pushups and pullups and weight exercises, and in general think about <em>fighting loads as the chief source of strength</em>.</p>
<p>For example: riding a bike won&#8217;t build much leg strength because it&#8217;s all concentric (pushing) with no eccentric (resisting). Adding in a few lunges as part of every day (or deep jumps, or squats of any form) will massively increase the benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Principle #4: Turn The World Into Your Gym<br />

<p>With these basics covered, we can move to the real world to find ways to apply them. You will never miss a workout again, because from now on <em>the entirety of every day you live will be a workout</em>. With your eye on potential ways to overload your muscles, opportunities will come out of the woodwork. So let&#8217;s make all this work in Real Life:</p>
<p><strong>Walk and Run for Transportation-  and Borrow Bikes when you Travel</strong><br />
Sidewalks and roads. Curbs and airport and hotel staircases. These are all amazing fitness machines, disguised as boring urban infrastructure. By seeking them out during travel, opportunities to stay fit magically materialize.</p>
<p>For example, when visiting people I make a point of borrowing one of their spare bikes if available. You can also install the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.spinlister.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spinlister</a></span><strong>*</strong> app on your phone, and rent bikes from locals &#8211; instead of cars from bland international rental car chains &#8211; whenever you&#8217;re on a trip.</p>
<p>As a result, I have enjoyed bike tours of dozens of US cities and even a good number of international spots that were often the highlight of the entire trip. If you seek to maximize your effort, the benefits come quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Lunge Whenever Nobody&#8217;s Looking<br />
</strong>You can transform the mild benefits of walking into a shockingly fast muscle builder you can do anywhere, just by learning how to lunge. The effectiveness comes from the fact that you&#8217;re causing peak muscle overload in a mostly-eccentric (downward) motion. I recently did one lap of deep lunges around a soccer field (which took all of about 90 seconds), and it was enough to give me pleasantly sore legs for two days.</p>
<p>Even better, you can explain that paragraph above to your friends, and challenge them to lunge a block together on as part of an evening outing &#8211; for example on your way out to happy hour. You&#8217;ll love the fun of doing this ridiculous thing together in public, and the reactions you&#8217;ll get from the strangers, almost as much as you love your new &lt;arnold voice&gt;<em> sculpted and bulging quadriceps and buttocks muscles</em> &lt;/arnold&gt;. Pain equals gain!</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Whenever you Can</strong><br />
Performing just a single 10-second sprint across a park or a parking lot can change your body for the better.  But you can also apply this principle on the bike, or during a set of pushups, or even when shoveling a driveway of snow. Any time you want to become better, challenge yourself to <em>max out for the next ten seconds!</em></p>
<p>Whenever you go to peak exertion, you are telling your body it is time to grow. If you stay within your comfort zone, the body decides it is fine as it is. Sprinting will send your body this change signal, in almost every situation.</p>
<p><strong>100 Pushups per Day</strong><br />
Or even 10 pushups if you&#8217;re new to the pastime. I love this exercise because it is so efficient: If I move as quickly as possible, I find it takes only 15 seconds to do 25 pushups. Since it is such a small commitment, it&#8217;s easy to keep to it four times throughout the day, resulting in a reasonable strengthening of the chest and associated muscles with a total time investment of <em>one minute. </em></p>
<p><em>Pro Tip: </em>I make myself drop for 25 or 50 pushups every time I am going to indulge in something questionable like a beer or a high-carb snack, to help compensate for the negative effects before they happen.</p>
<p><strong>Playgrounds and Gym Poaching</strong></p>
<p>Saving the best for last: although your own fancy gym may be far off in another country when you&#8217;re traveling, there is almost always a public park with a play structure that can provide many of the basics for free. You can sprint and do pullups, dips, jump off of high things and land dramatically in the sand, do situps, chase kids around, and generally get a surprisingly good workout.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Principle: Sugar is the Devil, Fat is your Friend</strong></p>
<p>The tips above will make a huge difference in any life that is currently too sedentary. But your body will fight to keep its fat reserves, and it will win this fight, if you obey its requests for constant sugar and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>For details I will refer you to <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/08/07/mr-money-mustache-vs-marks-daily-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Sissson&#8217;s primal blueprint</a>, or Tim&#8217;s <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slow Carb Diet</a>. But for me the basics are really simple: I avoid bread, pasta, and any desserts or sugary drinks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">including fruit juice</span>. And the idea of buying soda for home consumption or even ordering one at a restaurant is as horrifying to me as drinking drain cleaner. If your goal is fat loss, Do Not Drink Calories!</p>
<p>Instead I eat mostly vegetables, nuts, eggs,  oils (mostly olive but with no rules against butter and coconut oil!) and an average amount of minimally processed meats and dairy. It&#8217;s your basic low-carb diet, and I&#8217;ve found a 100% correlation between bending the rules of this diet (occasional pizza and beer), and the rapid softening of my waistline. If you haven&#8217;t tried this way of eating yet, you might be pleasantly surprised with how easy it is.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. Sure, there is much more to fitness than these five principles, but they are big ones, and enough go get started. This is infinitely better than not getting started, so let&#8217;s go.</p>

<p><em>Gary Taubes writes and rants about how our high-sugar, high-carbohydrate diet is the source of most of our problems.

But my own results and a recent rigorous blood test are good enough to keep me very enthusiastically on the high fat, high-vegetable, low-carb diet.</em></p>
